                  <note>The first edition of this work began publication in 1684 when a volume in Italian entitled "L'esploratore Turco" and a French version entitled "L'esplou du grand seigneur" were published in Paris by C. Barbin. Authorship is disputed, but it is generally agreed that the first fifty letters (the original four volumes) were written by Marana. In the English editions, v. 1 contains the substance of the letters commonly ascribed to Marana. The continuation (i.e. v. 2-8), said to have appeared first in English, has been variously ascribed to Robert Midgley and William Bradshaw; Bradshaw has also been attributed as the translator (from Marana's Italian manuscripts) of the entire work under Dr. Midgley's editorship. cf. DNB; also Gentleman's magazine, 1841, p. 270.</note>

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>OUR <hi>Arabian</hi> having met with ſo kind Entertainment in
this <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> ſince he put on the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Dreſs, is
reſolv'd to continue his Garb, and viſit you as often as Convenience will
permit.</p>
            <p>He brings along with him many Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Commodities, to gratify the
Various Expectations of People: His <hi>Cargo</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting of Jewels
and other Rarities, which are the Genuine Product of the <hi>Eaſt;</hi> and
ſome Kinds of Merchandiſe, which he has purchaſed here in the
<hi>Weſt,</hi> during his Reſidence at <hi>Paris.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It will be Pity to affront this Honeſt <hi>Stranger,</hi> by
raiſing Scandals on him, as if he were a Counterfeit, and I know not what.
This will appear Inhoſpitable, and Unworthy of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Candor
and Generoſity.</p>
            <p>To ſpeak without an <hi>Allegory,</hi> in this <hi>Third
Volume</hi> of <hi>Letters,</hi> as in the former <pb facs="tcp:99492:3"/>
               <hi>Two,</hi>
you'll find an Exact Continuation of <hi>Modern Hiſtory,</hi> acquainting you
with all the Memorable Sieges, Battels and Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagnes, that were in
<hi>Europe,</hi> from the Year 1645, to 1649. As alſo, with all the
Remarkable <hi>Negotiations</hi> and <hi>Tranſactions</hi> of <hi>State,
Embaſſies, Leagues</hi> and <hi>Overtures</hi> of <hi>Princes;</hi> the
<hi>Policies</hi> and <hi>Intrigues</hi> of <hi>Publick Miniſters,</hi>
eſpecially thoſe of <hi>Cardinal Mazarini;</hi> the Great and Stupendous
<hi>Revolutions</hi> and <hi>Civil Wars,</hi> in <hi>England, China, Naples,
Turky</hi> and <hi>Paris;</hi> the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious Riſe of a Poor Young
Beardleſs <hi>Fiſherman,</hi> to the Height of <hi>Sovereign Power;</hi>
the Diſmal <hi>Tragedies</hi> of an <hi>Engliſh King,</hi> and a
<hi>Chineſe Imperor;</hi> with the Murder of a <hi>Turkiſh Sultan.</hi>
And, all theſe, intermix'd with Proper and Uſeful Remarks, Pleaſant and
Agreeable Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries; couch'd in a Style, which being peculiar to the
<hi>Arabians,</hi> cannot be match'd in any other <hi>Writings</hi> that are
Extant.</p>
            <p>If his <hi>Philoſophy</hi> will not abide the Teſt of our
Learned <hi>Virtuoſi,</hi> yet it may paſs Muſter in a
<hi>Mahometan;</hi> ſince it is taken for granted, That the Men of that
<hi>Faith,</hi> rarely apply themſelves to ſuch Studies; or, at leaſt,
not in the Method us'd in <hi>Chriſtian Schools.</hi> They may have the 
<pb facs="tcp:99492:3"/>ſame <hi>Idea's</hi> of <hi>Natural</hi> Things as We; but they
expreſs themſelves in a different Manner.</p>
            <p>As for his <hi>Morals,</hi> they are Solid and Grave, and ſuch
as could not be repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended even in a <hi>Chriſtian Writer,</hi> if we
reduce what he ſays to <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſals.</hi> For, abſtracting from the
Particular Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions he had to his <hi>Native Religion,</hi> and to the
<hi>Grand Signior,</hi> whoſe <hi>Slave</hi> he was; there will be found
little Difference, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween his <hi>Ethicks</hi> and ours. He every where
recommends Loyalty, Juſtice, For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, Temperance, Prudence; and all
thoſe other Virtues, which are requiſite to fill up the <hi>Character</hi>
of a <hi>Hero,</hi> or a <hi>Saint.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And, who will not bear with him, for Patronizing the
<hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>Intereſt</hi> in which he was bred; it being
Natural for all Men, to adhere to the <hi>Notions,</hi> they have ſuck'd in
with their <hi>Mothers Milk?</hi> In this alſo, he ſhews great Moderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
and a more unbyaſs'd Temper, than one would expect from a <hi>Turk:</hi>
Which may, in Part, be aſcrib'd to his Studying in the <hi>Chriſtian
Academies,</hi> his Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with the Learned'ſt Men in
<hi>Paris,</hi> and ſome of the moſt Accompliſh'd Perſons in the World.
Hence it was, that he was <pb facs="tcp:99492:4"/>accus'd by his <hi>Superiors</hi> at the
<hi>Ottoman Port,</hi> of Inclining to <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> or
<hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſm;</hi> as he takes Notice, in his <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy</hi> to a
<hi>Religious Dignitary,</hi> in the Firſt <hi>Letter,</hi> of the Third
<hi>Book</hi> of this <hi>Volume,</hi> Pag. 255. to which the Reader is
referr'd for farther Satisfaction.</p>
            <p>In his moſt Familiar <hi>Letters,</hi> ſuch as this laſt
mention'd, and others to his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate Friends, you will find ſome
Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions, diſcovering a certain Fineneſs and Strength of Thought,
which is not very Common in <hi>Chriſtian Writers.</hi> Which is an Argument,
That the <hi>Mahometans</hi> are not all ſuch Block-Heads, as we take 'em
for.</p>
            <p>And, though his <hi>Picture,</hi> which we have affix'd to Our
<hi>Tranſlation,</hi> ſince we had the <hi>Italian Tomes,</hi> repreſents
no Extraordinary Perſon, yet you know <hi>Juvenal</hi>'s Remark, <hi>Fronti
mulla Fides.</hi> And, it has been a Common Obſervation of one of the
Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt <hi>Philoſophers</hi> in this Age, <hi>That by his Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Aſpect, no Man would gueſs, what an Illuſtrious Soul lodg'd
within.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If you would know, how the <hi>Italian</hi> came by this
<hi>Picture</hi> (for, in his <hi>Preface,</hi> he aſſerts it to be the
True <hi>Effigies</hi> of this <hi>Arabian</hi>) he ſays, That being
acquainted with the <hi>Secretary</hi> of <hi>Cardinal Mazarini,</hi> 
               <pb facs="tcp:99492:4"/>and frequenting his Houſe, he ſaw a <hi>Picture</hi> hang in
his <hi>Cloſet,</hi> with this <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription</hi> at the Bottom, TITUS
DE MOLDAVIA, CLERICUS. <hi>Aetatis ſuae</hi> LXXII. He ask'd the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman,
who this <hi>Titus</hi> was, who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd him, That he was a great
<hi>Travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler,</hi> and underſtood many <hi>Languages,</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially
the <hi>Sclavonian, Greek</hi> and <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bick;</hi> on which Account,
<hi>Cardinal Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieu,</hi> and his Succeſſor <hi>Mazarini,</hi> had made
great Uſe of him; and, That the Latter had caus'd that <hi>Picture</hi> of
the <hi>Moldavian</hi> to be drawn, and hung up in his <hi>Cloſet,</hi> from
whence he had it. Our <hi>Italian</hi> being ſatisfy'd, after ſome
Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe about him, That this <hi>Stranger</hi> was the very
<hi>Arabian,</hi> whoſe <hi>Writings</hi> he had ſo happily found, got
leave of the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, to have a Draught of the <hi>Picture</hi> taken, by a
Skilful <hi>Limner,</hi> which he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward plac'd in the <hi>Front</hi> of
his <hi>Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is one of theſe Letters, Pag. 306. wants a Beginning in
the <hi>Italian</hi> Copy. Which the <hi>Author</hi> of that
<hi>Tranſlation</hi> takes Notice of in his <hi>Preface,</hi> ſaying, That
by ſome Accident or other, the <hi>Arabick</hi> Paper had been torn
aſunder, and one, Part was miſſing.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:99492:5"/>There needs no more be ſaid, but to acquaint the
Reader, That we are going forward with the <hi>Engliſh Tranſlation</hi> of
theſe <hi>Letters,</hi> as faſt as we can. So that in all Probability, you
may expect a <hi>Fourth Volume</hi> before <hi>Chriſtmas.</hi> Wherein you
will find, more Particular Remarks on our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Affairs, with
Political Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes, on the Original and Diſſolution of Governments.
As alſo, many Curious Paſſages during the <hi>Wars</hi> of
<hi>Paris,</hi> which have not hitherto come to Publick View. In fine, you will
there be inform'd, of all the <hi>Remarkable Events,</hi> that happen'd at that
Time, either in <hi>Peace</hi> or <hi>War</hi> on the whole <hi>Globe.</hi>

               </head>
               <p>I Believe, the News of my Impriſonment, might fill thee with
Doubts of thy own Liberty; and, make thee careful to avoid at <hi>Vienna,</hi>
ſuch a Misfortune as befel me at <hi>Paris.</hi> Yet, if thou wert much
ſurprized at this Accident, it is an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, that thou art but a Novice in
the <pb n="2" facs="tcp:99492:13"/>World, and art yet to learn the firſt Rudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of
Uſeful Wiſdom, which teach us, <hi>That there is no Stedfaſtneſs in
Humane Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There has Nothing happned to me in this, which I was not before
provided for; neither did the ſuddenneſs of the Event, make me change
Countenance. I ſmil'd at the fulfilling my own Preſages; and, went to
Priſon as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concern'd, as I would have gone home to my Lodging. Not, that I
would have thee think, I was inſenſible of a Loſs ſo afflicting as that
of Liberty: but, my Chains did not appear ſo very formidable, having made
them fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar to my Thoughts long before.</p>
               <p>When I firſt came to <hi>Paris,</hi> I look'd on my ſelf,
but as a Priſoner at large; owing the freedom I had to walk about, only to
the Careleſsneſs of the <hi>State,</hi> and the favour of
<hi>Deſtiny.</hi> So that when that Indulgence was retrench'd, no new thing
happen'd to me. What I had expected for Seven Years to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, could not ſeem
ſtrange when it came to paſs.</p>
               <p>By what I have ſaid, thou may'ſt learn to prepare thy ſelf
for the Worſt Events, which commonly ſteal upon the ſecure and
unthinking; being wrapt up in greater Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Silence, than the Moments
which bring them to Light. Theſe ſlide away with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out our Advertiſement;
unſeen, unheard: Neither can our Watches or Dials, inform us any thing of
them, till they are paſs'd. So, there is no <hi>Index</hi> to point out to
us, the <pb n="3" facs="tcp:99492:13"/>
                  <hi>Hidden Decrees</hi> of <hi>Fate,</hi> till they
are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh'd; no <hi>Ephemeris</hi> of <hi>Deſtiny,</hi> but our own
Experience.</p>
               <p>Thou, and all thy Nation, are ſuſpected by the
<hi>Chriſtians:</hi> They eſteem you Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of their <hi>Intereſt,</hi>
as well as of their <hi>Law.</hi> They deſpiſe and vilifie you, calling
you, <hi>The accurſed of God.</hi> Yet, they admit you, as Members of their
Common-Wealth. They receive you to the Protection of their Laws, and entruſt
you with their Secrets, that they may ſerve themſelves of your Money. Thus
are you become Banquiers for your ſworn Enemies: And, while you profeſs an
Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Obedience to the Injunctions of <hi>Moſes,</hi> you make underhand
Leagues with the <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciples</hi> of <hi>Jeſus.</hi> I do not accuſe
your Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce with theſe <hi>Infidels;</hi> but, I ſay, you have Reaſon
to be upon your Guards, when you are environ'd with ſo many Millions of
Enemies. They are not ignorant of the Intimacies between the
<hi>Miniſters</hi> of the <hi>Sublime Port,</hi> and thoſe of Thy Nation:
It is common in the Mouths of the <hi>French, That the</hi> Jews <hi>are
the</hi> Turks <hi>Intelligencers.</hi> Thou oughteſt therefore, to have a
ſpecial Regard to thy Conduct, that no imprudent Action may expoſe thee to
the Jealouſy of the <hi>State</hi> where thou reſideſt. That
<hi>Court</hi> is full of Eyes; and, thou haſt need of a ſtricter Veil,
than what thou weareſt in the <hi>Synagogue.</hi> The very Walls of thy
Houſe, will betray thee; and, thy Domeſticks, may prove thy greateſt
Enemies: Yet, ſuſpect none more <pb n="4" facs="tcp:99492:14"/>than thy ſelf. This
will not ſeem harſh Counſel, if thou reflecteſt Twice on it; there
being nothing more certain, than, That it is not ſo eaſy to defend ones
ſelf from him in whom we confide, as from one we are jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous of: and, every
Man is apt to put too much Truſt in himſelf. I believe, thou art faithful,
and abhorreſt Treachery; yet, at the ſame Time, thou mayeſt be remiſs
and weak: What could not be extorted from thee by an Open Enemy, may be
diſcovered by the Inſinuations of a Pretended Friend. Thy own good Nature
may cajole thee; and therefore, 'twill be no ſmall Point of Wiſdom, <hi>to
beware of thy ſelf.</hi> As for Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingencies, I adviſe thee not to be
perplex'd about them, or be uneaſy. Thou canſt not avoid the Inevitable
Appointments of <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven:</hi> Only, be ready for the Worſt that may
happen; ſince, thou canſt never be certain of any Thing.</p>
               <p>Thy Predeceſſor <hi>Carcoa,</hi> was a Man of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite
Fore-caſt; always on his Watch, pry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into the dark Orb of Futurities; yet,
an Accident ſurprized him once, of which his ſtricteſt Caution never gave
him Warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. I read it in one of his Letters to the <hi>Kaimachan,</hi> which
thou ſenteſt me from <hi>Vienna.</hi> The Story is this. As he was one Day
writing <hi>Diſpatches</hi> to the <hi>Port,</hi> a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain tame Bird, which
he kept for his Diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſement, ſnatches from the Table, the Paper on which
he was writing to the <hi>Tefterdar;</hi> and, the Window being open, flies
with it out <pb n="5" facs="tcp:99492:14"/>into the Streets. The Paper was dropt in the
Garden of the <hi>Auguſtin Friars,</hi> at the very Moment when the
<hi>Spaniſh Ambaſſador,</hi> was walking there with the <hi>General</hi>
of that <hi>Order.</hi> 'Tis true, the Letter was unfiniſh'd, no Name
ſubſcribed, and ſo <hi>Carcoa</hi> eſcap'd an imminent Hazard of his
Life. But, the Secrets therein contain'd, gave a vaſt ſuſpici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the
<hi>Imperial Court;</hi> it being ſoon carry'd to the <hi>Principal
Secretary</hi> of <hi>State,</hi> and by him communicated to the
<hi>Emperor</hi> and <hi>Divan.</hi> Strict Inquiſition was made throughout
the City for the Author of that Letter. A Reward of a Thouſand
<hi>Rix-Dol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars,</hi> promis'd to any that would diſcover him. The Bird was
ſeen by many, to fly along with a Paper in her Bill; but, from whence ſhe
came, none knew. Nor had any curious Eye, attended her uncertain Motions back:
No Man divining, That that Paper was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned to tranſmit to the <hi>Ever
Happy Port,</hi> the moſt important Counſels of the <hi>German Empire.</hi>
Neither was <hi>Carcoa</hi>'s Hand taken Notice of, having lived very
privately, and uſed another Character in his common Deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings. But, how near
was he to a Diſcovery when he ſays himſelf in his Letter, That he wanted
but Five Words to the Concluſion, where he would have ſubſcribed his
Name! From hence thou mayeſt learn, That a <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riner</hi> in a Tempeſt,
amongſt Rocks and Sands, runs not greater Hazards, than he who acts in thy
<hi>Station.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="6" facs="tcp:99492:15"/>However, thou may'ſt now continue thy
Advices to <hi>Paris,</hi> but obſerve the Directions of <hi>Eliachim,</hi>
who brings thee this Letter. He will inform thee, of whatſoever is
neceſſary for thee to know; taking this Journey on Purpoſe, to prevent
the wakeful jealouſy, and active Inquiſition of <hi>Cardinal Mazarini,</hi>
from whom Nothing can be hid, that's tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted to the <hi>Poſts.</hi>
Receive him with ſingular Honour; he is an incorruptible Friend of the
<hi>Ottoman Port.</hi> From him thou ſhalt learn the ſafeſt Methods of

               <p>SInce my Releaſe, I have inform'd my ſelf of ſome
Paſſages, to which I was a Stranger during my Reſtraint. The
<hi>Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſylvanian Agent,</hi> continues ſtill at this <hi>Court;</hi> and,
his <hi>Negotiation</hi> is not now a <hi>Secret. Monſieur Croiſſy</hi>
is gone <hi>Ambaſſador Extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary</hi> to <hi>Prince Ragotski,</hi> on
the ſame Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rand, from this <hi>Crown.</hi> The Subject Matter of both their
<hi>Embaſſies,</hi> is a League. <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal Mazarini</hi> ſuſpected
Tergiverſation in that <hi>Prince,</hi> and that he would privately treat
with the <hi>Emperor,</hi> if the <hi>Grand Signior</hi> ſhould withdraw his
Aſſiſtance and Protection from him; or, if he himſelf ſhould grow
weary of the War. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Monſieur Croiſſy,</hi> according to the
<hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal</hi>'s Inſtructions, would not ſign the <hi>League,</hi> till
<hi>Ragotski</hi> had call'd Home his <hi>Ambaſſadors,</hi> who were
treating with the <hi>Imperialiſts</hi> at <hi>Tyrne,</hi> and ſent away
the <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Envoy</hi> from his Camp.</p>
               <p>The <hi>League</hi> being concluded, he inſiſted on the
Neceſſity the <hi>Prince</hi> lay under, of marching his Army nearer to
<hi>Torſtenſon,</hi> the <hi>Suediſh General,</hi> that ſo they might
ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port one another againſt the <hi>German</hi> Forces.</p>
               <p>This was the Pretence; but, in Reality, <pb n="8" facs="tcp:99492:16"/>it
was deſign'd to engage the <hi>Tranſylvani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> beyond the Power of a
Retreat; and, to poſt them under the Eye of the <hi>Suediſh General;</hi>
who ſoon after poſſeſſed himſelf of <hi>Tyrne,</hi> the Place
appointed for Treaty be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the <hi>Imperialiſts</hi> and <hi>Prince
Ragot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ski.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is a Town in the Lower <hi>Hungary,</hi> not far from
<hi>Preſburgh.</hi> The <hi>Suedes</hi> entred this Place the 17th of the 5th
<hi>Moon,</hi> but left a Garriſon in it of Seven Hundred <hi>Hungarian</hi>
Horſe, and Three Hundred Foot, according to their <hi>Articles</hi> with the
beſieg'd.</p>
               <p>Theſe were ſoon forc'd to quit the Town by <hi>Count
Forgatſch,</hi> an <hi>Imperialiſt,</hi> the <hi>Suedes</hi> and
<hi>Tranſylvanians</hi> being march'd a great Diſtance off: And, 'tis
ſaid, this <hi>Hungarian</hi> Garriſon, yielded not unwillingly to the
<hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial</hi> Arms.</p>
               <p>'Tis certain, <hi>General Torſtenſon</hi> puts but ſmall
Confidence in the <hi>Hungarian</hi> Soldiers: For, above Six Hundred of the
Common Sort deſerted him, the 29th of the 5th <hi>Moon,</hi> and the reſt
raiſed ſuch frequent Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mults and Mutinies, that their Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders ſtood
in more Fear of them, than of their Enemies. It's reported likewiſe, That
there has been lately no good Underſtanding between <hi>Ragotski</hi> and
<hi>Torſtenſon,</hi> about the deſigned Siege of <hi>Preſburgh:</hi>
The former ſeeming too much to favour the <hi>Hungarians,</hi> and being
rather inclined to carry his Arms into the <hi>Emperor</hi>'s Hereditary
Countries. Yet he would not conſent, that <hi>Preſburgh</hi> 
                  <pb n="9" facs="tcp:99492:16"/>ſhould be in the Hands of the <hi>Suedes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>French</hi> ſay, that this <hi>Prince</hi> is
humo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and wavering, yet of a fair Intention; but, that the greateſt Part
of his Officers, are corrupted by the <hi>Emperor:</hi> And, that therefore,
both they and the Common Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diery, were for Peace; only his Wife, his Son, and
ſome few of his Counſellors, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded him to adhere to the
<hi>Suedes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They add, that the <hi>Young Prince,</hi> being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed by
his Mother, one Day in a full Aſſembly of the Chief Commanders, made the
following <hi>Oration, Ragotski</hi> himſelf be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing alſo preſent:</p>
               <q> 
                  <p> PErmit me, moſt Serene and Illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrious Prince, my Royal
Father, to perform the Part of a Dutiful Son, a Faithful Counſellor, and a
Loyal Subject. The <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>Nature</hi> and of <hi>Nations,</hi>
entitles you to my <hi>Obedience;</hi> and, the particular Honour you have done
me, in admitting me to your Cabinet, obliges me to exemplifie it, in an humble
Remonſtrance of my Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, at a Time when the Intereſt of
<hi>Tranſylvania</hi> calls for freedom of Advice.</p> 
                  <p> It is with no ſmall Complacency, that I now behold you
encompaſſed with a Circle of <hi>Heroes,</hi> whoſe Valour and Fidelity
may give ſuch a Luſtre to <pb n="10" facs="tcp:99492:17"/>your Victorious Arms, as
ſhall eclipſe the Glory of the <hi>Roman</hi> and <hi>Grecian</hi>
Conquerors. The <hi>Alexanders, Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſars, Scipio's,</hi> and
<hi>Hannibals,</hi> ſhall no longer draw the World into an Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration of
their obſolete Atchieve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. The <hi>Regiſter</hi> of your
<hi>Deeds,</hi> ſhall foil their <hi>antiquated Hiſtories;</hi> whilſt
<hi>Plutarch, Tacitus,</hi> and <hi>Livy,</hi> muſt veil to <hi>Modern
Pens,</hi> the <hi>Recorders</hi> of your <hi>Matchleſs Actions.</hi>
                  </p> 
                  <p> Let not the crafty Inſinuations of the <hi>German Court,</hi>
warp your Reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and cajole you with the deceitful Umbrages of
<hi>Peace,</hi> only to gain Time, that they may more ſucceſsfully carry on
the War. Neither ſuffer your ſelves, already in Part Victorious, to be
a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus'd with feigned Treaties, and O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertures which you cannot but ſuſpect.
We are now in a Condition to give the Law; and, ſhould <hi>Fortune</hi> turn
the Scale, it will ſtill be in our Power to make our own Terms of
Compoſition. The <hi>Alliances</hi> of <hi>Sueden</hi> and <hi>France,</hi>
have rais'd us to a Capacity of bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving all <hi>Europe:</hi> Whilſt the One
with a Potent Army on the <hi>Rhine,</hi> the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther on the <hi>Danube,</hi>
keep the <hi>Imperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aliſts</hi> in ſuch perpetual Action, that it 
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:99492:17"/>will be impoſſible for them to Barrier <hi>Germany</hi>
from our Conquering Arms. Now is the Time to raiſe <hi>Tranſylvania</hi>
above the <hi>Title</hi> of a <hi>Tributary Province,</hi> and reſtore this
<hi>Kingdom</hi> to her An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Renown. If we miſs this Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity, we
muſt for ever be <hi>Slaves</hi> to the <hi>Turks</hi> or <hi>Germans.</hi>
Let us not ſeek any longer Protection, but from the juſtice of our Cauſe
and the Dint of our Swords. Let not <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Sueden,</hi>
boaſt of their <hi>Turenne,</hi> their <hi>Torſtenſon,</hi> as if no
other Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on could furniſh the World with fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous <hi>Generals!</hi>
Whilſt <hi>Prince Ragotski</hi> lives, and lives at the Head of ſuch an
Army, your Fidelity and Courage, ſhall render his Name more terrible than
that of <hi>Tamerlain,</hi> and his At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts more proſperous than thoſe of
<hi>Scanderbeg.</hi> And our Poſterity ſhall be oblig'd, to raiſe
<hi>Pyramids</hi> to your Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour; and, from your preſent At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievements, to
date a New <hi>Epocha,</hi> the Eternal <hi>Memoir</hi> of
<hi>Tranſylvania</hi>'s Redemption.</p> 
               </q>
               <p>'Tis ſaid, that <hi>Ragotski</hi> was not very well pleas'd
with his Son's <hi>Speech,</hi> ſuſpecting that he held ſome private
Correſpondence with <hi>Torſtenſon,</hi> for whom he had no great
Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection. <pb n="12" facs="tcp:99492:18"/>Laſt <hi>Moon</hi> he inſiſted
earneſtly on the Money and Men promiſed him by <hi>Reben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtock.</hi> But,
<hi>General Torſtenſon</hi> thought it ſufficient, that he himſelf was
ſo near him with his Forces. Yet, leſt he ſhould take an Occaſion of
Diſcontent, he ſent him a Supply of Money; though he was not without ſome
Apprehenſions, that the <hi>Prince</hi> having receiv'd it, would underhand
treat with the <hi>Emperor.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>'Tis ſaid here, that a <hi>Chiaus</hi> was arriv'd in the
<hi>Tranſylvanian</hi> Camp, expreſly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidding <hi>Ragotski</hi> to
enter into the <hi>Hereditary Provinces</hi> of the <hi>Emperor.</hi> But, that

the future Repoſitory of my Old Age. When I think of that City, 'tis with a
Paſſion hardly ſecond to that, which I cheriſh for the Place of my

Proſpect of the <hi>Earth</hi> and all its Gay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eties; yet, they preſent us

ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us <hi>Paradiſe,</hi> with its glittering Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants, the

left my Father; or rather, he left me before I found my ſelf, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but an
Infant when he dyed: but, in the <hi>City</hi> I found Friends, which is not a

<pb n="17" facs="tcp:99492:20"/>before I could diſtinguiſh Miſery from Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs.
But, they gave me Education, which taught me how to ſhun thoſe Evils, which
are the Natural Conſequences of our Birth. So that in the Main, I am more
indebted to them than to him. Let it be how it will, I cannot ceaſe to love
them, and often wiſh my ſelf with them. This is Second Nature. And,
becauſe I cannot have my Deſires fulfill'd in that, I gratify my ſelf by
often writing to them. Should I make Compariſons, thou wilt ſay, I am a
Flatterer. Suffice it to tell thee, That thou art one of the Number, whoſe
Remembrance affects me with ſenſible Complacency. Yet, I cannot write to
thee, nor any of my Friends, ſo often as I would, without entrenching on the
Obligations I have to the other <hi>Miniſters</hi> of the <hi>Sublime

to ſay ſomething of it. The <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perialiſts</hi> owe that Triumph, to
the Candor of <hi>Turenne,</hi> and the degenerate Craft of the <hi>Duke</hi>
of <hi>Bavaria;</hi> who, to lull the <hi>French</hi> in a Fatal Security,
ſent an <hi>Agent</hi> into <hi>France,</hi> to negotiate a Peace, with
deceitful Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and Umbrages; commanding alſo, that none of his

                  <hi>French</hi> their
Enemies. Yet, ſome lay the Blame of this Overthrow, on the <hi>Suedes;</hi>
whoſe unſeaſonable Suſpicion of a <hi>Private Treaty</hi> between the
<hi>French</hi> and <hi>Germans,</hi> hindred <hi>Torſtenſon</hi> from
joining the former; and, expos'd <hi>Turenne,</hi> with his raw and
un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>experienced Forces, to the numerous Army of veterane
<hi>Imperialiſts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>'Twas a Fatal Engagement, and the <hi>French</hi> loſt many

Fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen Hundred of the Common Soldiers, Fifty Enſigns, with many Waggons,
and Four Mules laden with Money.</p>
               <p>It is reported, that whilſt <hi>Turenne,</hi> in the general

unfortunately ſtumbled at his Chamber-Door: With the Noiſe of which,
<hi>Turenne</hi> awaked; and, fearing ſome Attempt on his Life, leap'd off

               <p>AT length thou haſt condeſcended to beg my Pardon, for the
Calumnies thy Tongue has loaded me with. I am not ill pleaſed with thy
Letter. It abounds with elegant Expreſſions of thy Sorrow, for an Offence
to which thou hadſt no Provocation. Thy Submiſſion, tho' late, abates my
Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentment; and, if thou performeſt thy Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, 'tis baniſh'd. The
firſt Crime ſo inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouſly <pb n="20" facs="tcp:99492:22"/>acknowledg'd, claims a
Title to Forgiveneſs: Let Eternal Oblivion ſeal it. I am not by Nature
revengeful. I rather bluſh for Shame, than grow pale with An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, at him that
injures me. Yet, Self-Preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation will rouze our Choler; which is the
moſt active Humour, and precipitates ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny to violent Courſes. The Effect
it has on me, is, to put me on my Guard, leſt he who has wrong'd me, without
any Signs of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, ſhould continue his Malice to my Deſtruction.
But, thou haſt diſpers'd all my Suſpicions, by thy ſeaſonable
Addreſs; and, if I cannot pronounce thee Innocent, I will believe thou art
not Incorrigible. The beſt Advice I can give thee, is, henceforwards to
at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to thy own Affairs, and refrain from thoſe of others; remembring the
<hi>Arabian</hi> Proverb, <hi>He that peeps in at his Neighbour's Window, may
chance to loſe his Eyes.</hi> There is a great deal of Wiſdom, couch'd in
theſe ſhort Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences. They are not the Product of <hi>one</hi> Man's
Experience, nor of a <hi>few;</hi> but, they are the Reſult of
<hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal</hi> Obſervation. And, our Country has been happy above
o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in the choice of her <hi>Proverbs.</hi> This that I mention'd is
peculiar to the <hi>Eaſt:</hi> Yet, I can produce an Inſtance, whereby
'twas lately verified in the <hi>Weſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There is hardly a Night paſſes in this Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulous City,
wherein ſome Murder is not committed in the Streets. Two Nights ago, a Man
was found dead on the Ground, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon a Tumult was gathered about his 
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:99492:22"/>Bleeding Carkaſe. Among the reſt, a Fellow came
crowding in, inquiſitive what ſhould be the Matter. Thoſe who ſtood by,
be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding his Cloaths bloody, which he was not ſenſible of himſelf,
ſeized on him as the Murderer. His wild Looks encreaſed their Jealouſie;
and, the incoherent Words with which he endeavour'd to excuſe himſelf,
ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred him Guilty in the Judgment of the Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. They carried him before a
<hi>Cadi,</hi> by whom he was ſtrictly examin'd: He ſtoutly deny'd the
Fact; and, no Proof could be brought againſt him, but his ſtained Cloaths.
'Tis the Cuſtom here, to put to the Torture, Perſons ſuſpected of
Capital Crimes, in Order to draw a Confeſſion of the Truth. This they did
to this poor Wretch; and, in the Extremity of his Pains, he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg'd, he
had kill'd his Wife that Evening, but was altogether Innocent of this poor
Man's Death, who was Murder'd in the Streets. All the Torments they inflicted,
could force no other Confeſſion from him, ſave that which his real Guilt
prompted him to make. For which, he was condemned to Death, according to the
Laws. Thou ſeeſt by this, that had he gone about his Buſineſs, without
prying into other Mens Matters, he might have eſcap'd a Diſcovery. But,
that mediing Itch of the Imprudent, betray'd him (not without the particular
Direction of <hi>Fate</hi>) to a Death, which indeed he merited, but not on the
Score of the murder'd Man, whom he went out of his Way to ſee.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="22" facs="tcp:99492:23"/>Thou wilt ſay, this Story is not

Reflection on thy paſt Offence (let it be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten); but, as a Caution for
the future, not to engage thy ſelf, in Matters out of thy Sphere. For, a
buſie Body, is never without Trouble.</p>
               <p>Above all, I counſel thee, to practiſe the Government of the
Tongue, which is a great Virtue, eſpecially in the <hi>Courts</hi> of

               <p>Thou haſt no Reaſon to take in ill Part, the Freedom with
which I adviſe thee for thy Good; unleſs, thou thinkeſt thy ſelf too
Old to learn. But, I have a better Opinion of thee, than to rank thee among
<hi>Pythagoras</hi>'s Aſſes.</p>
               <p>I have ſaid enough for a Friend; too much for an Enemy. It is

               </head>
               <p>THOU haſt never vouchſafed to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the Advice I
ſent thee ſome Years ago, of a <hi>Chriſtian</hi>'s Deſign againſt
thy Life. Perhaps he wanted an Opportunity, to put. his Revenge in Execution
that Way; and therefore, the Caution I gave thee, look'd like a falſe Alarm.
Thou truſteſt in thy Courage, the Strength of thy Veſſel, the Multitude
and Fidelity of thy <hi>Slaves,</hi> and thinkeſt thy ſelf invulnerable.
But, let me tell thee, That neither thy Courage, nor thy Veſſel, can defend
thee from the <hi>Stroke</hi> of <hi>Deſtiny;</hi> and thou haſt no greater
Enemies than thoſe who eat thy Bread. Whether it be, the Continuance of thy
Cruelty; or, the Natural Regret of Servitude has rend'red them ſo, I know
not; but, if what I am in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd of be true, thou art the miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſt Man
in the World. Wert thou only in danger to loſe thy Life by a Stab, a Bullet,
or the ſwift Effects of Poiſon, it would be a Happineſs, in Compariſon
of the Method that is now taken to deſtroy thee: And, the Inviſible Death
which thou wert formerly to receive from a <hi>Prayer-Book,</hi> would have
been ſoft as the Stroke of <hi>Cupid</hi>'s Arrow, in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect 
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:99492:24"/>of the <hi>Tragical</hi> and <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nheard-of Fate,</hi>
which is now preparing for thee. Think not I go about to amuſe, or, affright
thee with <hi>Chimaera</hi>'s and <hi>Tales,</hi> ſuch as Nurſes uſe to
awe their Children into Compliance and good Manners. What I tell thee, is
Matter of Fact; and, confirm'd by many Letters from <hi>Italy,</hi> to
ſeveral eminent <hi>Merchants</hi> in <hi>Paris.</hi> I have ſeen ſome of
them, and hear that the reſt agree in the ſame Relation.</p>
               <p>They give an Account, That at <hi>Naples,</hi> on the Second of
the laſt <hi>Moon,</hi> Three <hi>Witches</hi> were ſeized, and accuſed
of practiſing <hi>Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolical Arts;</hi> of enchanting ſeveral Perſons;
of doing great Miſchief; and, in fine, of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving private Commerce with the
<hi>Devil.</hi> They ſtoutly denied all at firſt, and made very ſubtle
and plauſible Apologies. Inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much, as the <hi>Inquiſitors</hi> were
almoſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded of their Innocence; till it was ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted, That
their Houſes ſhould be ſearch'd. <hi>Officers</hi> were ſent
accordingly: who, after a narrow Scrutiny, found ſome <hi>Magical</hi> Books,
ſeveral Vials of ſtrange Liquors, Pots of Ointment, with an <hi>Image</hi>
of <hi>Wax,</hi> reſembling a Man, but partly melted. There were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printed
on the Breaſt of the <hi>Image,</hi> ſeveral unknown Characters, Figures
and <hi>Magical</hi> Symbols: And, on the Forehead was to be read, <hi>ZELIM
EBEN SAGRAN.</hi> All theſe were brought, and expoſed before the
<hi>Inquiſitors</hi> (of whoſe <hi>Office</hi> thou art not ignorant.)
Great Deliberation was had, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout this unuſual Emergency. The
<hi>Imaums</hi> 
                  <pb n="25" facs="tcp:99492:24"/>and <hi>Cheiks,</hi> were ſent for and
conſulted. The <hi>Witches</hi> were examined apart; and put to the Torture,
as is the Cuſtom in Capital Crimes. Admirable was their Conſtancy for a
conſiderable Time; but, at length, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come by the Continuance and
Sharpneſs of their Pains, they confeſs'd, They had for ſome Years
practis'd <hi>Magick Arts,</hi> convers'd with <hi>Familiar Spirits,</hi>
rais'd Tempeſts, Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quakes, and done other wicked Feats. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing examin'd
about the <hi>Image</hi> of <hi>Wax,</hi> they declar'd, That it was the
<hi>Image</hi> of a <hi>Turkiſh Captain</hi> of a <hi>Gally,</hi> whoſe
Name was written on the Forehead: And, that they were hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, by certain
<hi>Italians,</hi> who had been <hi>Slaves</hi> in the <hi>Gally</hi> of the
ſaid <hi>Captain,</hi> to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witch him to Death, in the moſt lingring
Method they could invent: That, in Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to this, they had made this
<hi>Image;</hi> That every Night they met together, with a <hi>Fourth</hi> of
their Gang, (who was not to be found) and made a Fire of the <hi>Bones</hi> of
<hi>Dead Men,</hi> which they ſtole from the <hi>Graves</hi> and
<hi>Charnel-Houſes:</hi> That they laid this <hi>Image</hi> down at a
convenient Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, before this Fire, repeating certain <hi>Magical
Words</hi> and <hi>Charms;</hi> and, as this <hi>Image</hi> gradually melted,
ſo the Body of the ſaid <hi>Turkiſh Captain,</hi> did inſenſibly
waſte and decay. And, to add to his lingring Death an intolerable Torment,
they baſted the melting <hi>Image,</hi> with the Oyls and other Liquors,
which were contain'd in the Vials and Pots: That, by this Means, he was 
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:99492:25"/>perpetually rack'd with moſt pungent and acute Pains in
his Bowels, Head, and all Parts of his Body; raging under moſt violent
Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, inſatiable Thirſt, and Want of Sleep. Finally, That this lingring
Kind of Death would continue, as long as they pleas'd to protract the
Diſſolution of the <hi>Waxen Image.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This <hi>Confeſſion,</hi> though extorted from the
<hi>Witches</hi> in the Midſt of inſufferable Torments, yet was delivered
without any Inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtencies, and with all the Demonſtrations of a real
Penitence. And, being ſeconded with the Teſtimonies of many Credible
Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, who had overſeen them in ſome of their <hi>Nocturnal
Ceremonies;</hi> the <hi>Inquiſitors,</hi> moved with a juſt Horror of ſo
nefandous Abominations, ſentenc'd them, <hi>To be burnt, and their Aſhes to
be ſcatter'd into the Sea.</hi> Which was accordingly executed, on the Sixth
of the laſt <hi>Moon,</hi> in the Preſence of infinite Spectators.</p>
               <p>The News of this Extraordinary Event, is freſh in the Mouths
of almoſt all the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of this City; Yet, no Man, I dare ſay, hears
it with that Concern for the <hi>Turkiſh Captain,</hi> as I do. Even thoſe
among the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> who abhorr <hi>Witchcraft,</hi> would
nevertheleſs rejoice, if not only thou, but all the <hi>Muſſulmans</hi>
were deſtroyed with <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chantments;</hi> ſince, they can never hope, it
will come to paſs by the Succeſs of their Arms.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="27" facs="tcp:99492:25"/>I am not credulous of every Story that is
related of <hi>Witches,</hi> being ſatisfy'd, That <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition</hi>
and <hi>Ignorance,</hi> has liſted many in that <hi>Infernal</hi> Number, who
were Innocent and never deſerv'd it: Some having been forc'd, by Racks and
Tortures, to confeſs themſelves Guilty of practiſing
<hi>Enchantments,</hi> when, after their Execution, there have appear'd evident
Proofs to the contrary. Yet, I cannot be ſure, but that there have been
ſome in all Ages and Nations, who have entred into Leagues and
Aſſociations with <hi>Devils,</hi> and have been enabled thereby, to
perform Things above the Power of <hi>Nature.</hi> However, I have a Particular
Deſire to hear from thee, and to be inform'd, Whether thou haſt
expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienc'd the Effect of their <hi>Enchantments.</hi> If thou haſt not,
bleſs thy Stars, that thou wert born and bred a <hi>Muſſulman,</hi>
againſt whom the <hi>Magick</hi> of the <hi>Infidels</hi> cannot prevail;
and, that thou haſt ſwallow'd the <hi>Impreſſion</hi> of
<hi>Mahomet</hi>'s <hi>Seal,</hi> which is of Force to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve and make
invalid, all the <hi>Charms</hi> of <hi>Men</hi> and <hi>Devils.</hi> But, if
thou haſt felt the Force of their <hi>Enchantments,</hi> and pineſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
with unaccountable Pains and Languors; then, think with thy ſelf, That thou
art de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective in keeping ſome <hi>Point</hi> of our <hi>Holy Law;</hi> That
<hi>Mahomet</hi> is angry with thee, withdraws his Protection, and expoſes
thee to the Malice of <hi>Evil Spirits.</hi> Neither per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade thy ſelf,
That becauſe the <hi>Three Witches</hi> are put to Death, thou ſhalt
preſently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover thy former Health and Eaſe again: <pb n="28" facs="tcp:99492:26"/>For, ſo long as there is a <hi>Fourth</hi> living; and out of the
Reach of <hi>Juſtice,</hi> thou art not ſafe. Nay, if ſhe were taken and
executed too; ſo long as thy Enemies are yet alive, who firſt employ'd
theſe <hi>Hags,</hi> thou art ſtill at their Mercy. They will ſearch
every Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of <hi>Italy,</hi> and of all <hi>Europe,</hi> but they will find
Inſtruments of their Revenge. They will rummage <hi>Hell</hi> it ſelf, to
gratifie their Fury. The beſt Counſel I can give thee in this Caſe, is,
To pacifie thine Enemies, by extraordinary Acts of Civility to the
<hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians,</hi> where-ever thou meeteſt them; by uſing thy
<hi>Slaves</hi> mildly, and giving them their Freedom, after a limited Time of
Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice; without exacting a Ranſom, which neither they, nor their Relations
and Friends can ever be able to pay. This will abate the Rancour of the
<hi>Infidels,</hi> and turn their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge into Kindneſs and Love. Thou wilt
every where be free from Dangers; and, thoſe very Perſons, who now ſtudy
all Means to take away thy Life, will then hazard their own to preſerve thee
from Death.</p>
               <p>Think not, that I go about to perſuade thee to change Temper
with thy <hi>Slaves,</hi> and, from the Reſolution and Bravery of a <hi>True
Muſſulman,</hi> to ſink into the abject Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſneſs of a
<hi>Chriſtian.</hi> Be fearful only of <hi>thy ſelf,</hi> and ſtand in
Awe of none more than of thy <hi>own Conſcience.</hi> There is a
<hi>Cato</hi> in every Man, a <hi>ſevere Cenſor</hi> of his

<hi>Authority</hi> of thy <hi>Station,</hi> tempt thee to be Cruel or Unjuſt;
but, in all Things, <hi>Do as thou wouldſt be done unto.</hi> This is a

               <p>IF One may judge of future Events, by ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying to them the
Symptoms of Things paſt; and, if a Man may compare one King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom with another;
I ſhould think, that <hi>France</hi> will in Time extend the <hi>Limits</hi>
of her <hi>Empire,</hi> as far as any of the <hi>Four Great Monarchies,</hi>
that have been recorded in <hi>Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtories</hi> for their
<hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal</hi> Sway. I will not ſay, as far as the wide-ſtretch'd
<hi>Empire</hi> of the ever-victorious <hi>Oſmans:</hi> Yet, the
<hi>Genius</hi> of this Nation, ſeems in ſome Manner to inſpire the
<hi>French</hi> with as ardent a Thirſt of Glory and Conqueſt, as that
which has in all Ages, appear'd to be the <hi>Inſeparable Vertue</hi> of the
<hi>Muſſulmans.</hi> They preſs forward to the <pb n="30" facs="tcp:99492:27"/>Mark,
for which they take up Arms; that is, to ſubdue All before them, and lay
King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, Provinces and Cities at the Feet of their <hi>Sovereign.</hi> They
are not diſcourag'd at Difficulties and Loſſes. The Checks and
Oppoſitions they meet with, do but animate them with new and freſh Vigors.
So that it is become a ſure Prognoſtick of ſome great Succeſs to that
Nation, when at any Time they receive ill News from their Armies. In this,
their Courage ſeems to be of the Quality of <hi>Naptha;</hi> which, by
pouring on of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, takes Fire; although, thou knoweſt, theſe Two
<hi>Elements</hi> be Contrary to each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. So, this Warlike People,
inſtead of being dejected, or made timorous by any De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feat given to their
Armies, are rather inflam'd with more active and valiant Reſolutions; as will
appear, by the Repulſe given them by the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Bavaria,</hi>
not many <hi>Moons</hi> ago.</p>
               <p>As ſoon as that News arrived in this City, one would have
expected to have ſeen ſome Tokens of Fear in the People; but, it wrought a
contrary Effect. No Tears of Women and Children, no compaſſionate Sighs for
their ſlain Husbands, Fathers or other Relations; no down-caſt Looks, or
ominous ſhaking of Heads; no melancholly Whiſpers or porten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous Stories,
were murmur'd in the Ears of the Multitude: But, all Things appear'd lively and
proſperous; the very Women ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citing the Young Men to liſt themſelves
Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, and the Boys in the Streets making <pb n="31" facs="tcp:99492:27"/>all their
Paſtime conſiſt, in imitating the <hi>Men</hi> of <hi>Arms,</hi> and
learning the <hi>Diſcipline</hi> of <hi>War.</hi> There was no need, to force
Men to the Field. No ſooner was the King's Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to raiſe New Forces
divulg'd in the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces,</hi> but Thouſands came voluntarily and took
up Arms; chuſing rather to ſeek Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Deaths in the Toils and Hazards
of War, than to lead Inglorious Lives at Home, in the ſoft Enjoyments of
Peace.</p>
               <p>Theſe Things appear'd to me, as certain Preſages of the
Riſing Greatneſs of this <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy,</hi> and an Evident Sign, That the

               <p>The Stage of that Bloody Combat, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Forces of the

been a more fierce Encounter, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the <hi>French</hi> and
<hi>Imperialiſts</hi> at <hi>Aller<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheim.</hi> Wherein the former, have
recover'd the Honour they ſeem'd to have loſt in the <hi>Spring,</hi> owing

who, with his Regiments, had a conſiderable Share in the Actions of this Day;
and therefore, has been preſented with Magnificent Gifts by the

Thouſand Common Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, beſides many Officers of Note. On the
<hi>French</hi> Side, the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Enguien</hi> (who had newly

Two <pb n="32" facs="tcp:99492:28"/>other Commanders. <hi>Monſieur Grammond</hi> was
taken Priſoner; but, honourably treated and ſent away with Preſents by
the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> together with Inſtructions about a
Neutrality; who is exchang'd for a <hi>German</hi> of equal Quality. The
<hi>French</hi> have alſo loſt in this Battle, above a Thouſand of the
Common Soldiers; ſo that their Victory coſt them dear.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Enguien,</hi> notwithſtanding his
Wounds, marches on the next Day with his Army to <hi>Norlinghen,</hi> offering
to that Town a Neutrality, and Liberty for the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon to march out, which
conſiſted of Three Hundred <hi>Bavarians.</hi> But, receiving a fierce
Anſwer from the <hi>Governor,</hi> he caus'd the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches to be made in
Order to an Aſſault, which was begun that very Night, and a Breach made in
the Walls; upon which, the Inhabitants were forc'd to intercede with the
<hi>Duke,</hi> that there might be a Ceſſation of Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence till the next
Morning, promiſing, that then the Soldiers ſhould ſurrender at
Diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; which was done accordingly.</p>
               <p>There he tarried Eight Days, to refreſh his Army. Then he
marched to <hi>Dunkenſpule,</hi> which was defended by a Garriſon of Five
Hundred <hi>Bavarians.</hi> He took this Place by Storm, yet gave Quarter to
the Soldiers, who laid down their Arms, and yielded themſelves Priſoners.
Leaving a Garriſon of Three Hundred <hi>French</hi> in the Town, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mov'd
his Forces toward <hi>Heilbrun.</hi> But, in regard this Place was defended by
Fifteen <pb n="33" facs="tcp:99492:28"/>Hundred Men, he forbore to aſſault it, and only
Quarter'd his Army in the Neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Villages.</p>
               <p>Since that Time, which was about the Middle of the laſt
<hi>Moon,</hi> there has been no conſiderable Action between the
<hi>French</hi> and the <hi>Germans.</hi> Yet, thoſe who pretend to be vers'd
in <hi>Military</hi> Affairs, laugh at the ill Conduct of the Arch-<hi>Duke
Leopold;</hi> who, when he had the <hi>French</hi> ſhut up in a Narrow
<hi>Streight,</hi> through which it was impoſſible for them to paſs, but
by ſingle Files, neglected that Opportunity to cut them off; deferring the
Victory (whereof he was too ſecure) till the next Day, by Reaſon of the
preſent Wearineſs of his Soldiers. In the mean Time <hi>Turenne,</hi> with
his whole Army, paſs'd the <hi>Streight</hi> in the Dead of the Night, and
came to <hi>Philipsburgh.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Overſight of the <hi>General,</hi> is much talk'd of;
becauſe, had he purſu'd his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, he had not only entirely defeated
the <hi>French,</hi> but, in all Probability, falling with the whole Force of
the <hi>Empire</hi> on the <hi>Suedes,</hi> he had likewiſe vanquiſh'd
them, and ſo put an End to the War. But, it ſeems, as if the
<hi>Inſcrutable Providence</hi> had determin'd to infatuate the Minds of the
<hi>Germans,</hi> and reſerve thoſe Two Potent Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, their Enemies, to
be a farther Scourge to the <hi>Empire.</hi>

<hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>I Am weary of writing News of Battles and Sieges to the
<hi>Grandees;</hi> and, I know, thou ſeldom troubleſt thy ſelf with the
Care of Foreign Tranſactions. Beſides, I have no certain Intelligence of
Moment to commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate. But, I can acquaint thee with ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more
agreeable to thy Studies and <hi>Genius.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here is a Man in this City, who was not born Blind, but by
ſome ill Hap loſt the Uſe of his Eyes. Yet, <hi>Nature</hi> ſeems to
have recompens'd that Misfortune, in the Exqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiteneſs of his
<hi>Feeling.</hi> Thou wouldſt ſay, he carried Eyes in his Fingers Ends;
ſince he diſtinguiſhes thoſe Things by his <hi>Touch,</hi> which are
the only proper Objects of <hi>Sight.</hi> Believe me, I think there can be no
Deceit or Confederacy, whereby he might blind o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, <pb n="35" facs="tcp:99492:29"/>inſtead of being ſo himſelf. I ſaw him muffled up with a
Napkin which cover'd all his Face, when divers Pieces of <hi>Eaſtern</hi>
Silks of various Colours, were laid on a Table be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him. He felt them
attentively, and told us the Colour of each Piece exactly. I, who was never
over-credulous of extraordinary Pretences, ſuſpecting that either the
Fineneſs of the Linen which veil'd his Face, might give him ſome Glimpſe
of the different Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours; or, that ſome By-ſtander, with ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed Signs,
might inform him; caus'd all the Company to withdraw, except a Learned
<hi>Derviſe,</hi> who was intimate with me. We threw a thick Velvet-Mantle
over his Face, which reached down to his Navel, girding it about his Waſte,
ſo as to leave his Arms at Liberty. Then I procur'd ſmall Shreds of Silks,
ſuch as I could conceal in the Palm of my Hand: Theſe I caus'd him to touch
with his Fingers, brought up as high as his Chin, ſo that 'twas
impoſſible for him to ſee them, had he had the Uſe of his Eyes: Yet, he
made not the leaſt Miſtake in Five ſeveral Colours. We chang'd the Order
of the Silks, and ſometimes gave him the ſame Piece Four or Five Times
together; yet, as ſoon as he had felt it, he readily told us, 'Twas the
ſame Colour.</p>
               <p>I tell thee, O learned <hi>Hali,</hi> ſuch an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>common
Experiment, afforded me Matter both of Delight and Wonder. I concluded from
hence, That <hi>Nature</hi> is no Niggard in her Gifts, but ſupplies the
Defects of one <pb n="36" facs="tcp:99492:30"/>Sence, by the ſuperabundant Accuracy of
a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother. We ask'd this blind Perſon, by what Diſtinction he thus knew one
Colour from another, without the Help of his Eyes. He was not able to expreſs
the particular Manner of this diſcriminating Senſation; but, only told us
in General, That he felt as much Difference between the <hi>Red</hi> Silk and
<hi>Black,</hi> as he had formerly done during the Enjoyment of his Eye-Sight,
between the <hi>Silks</hi> of <hi>Perſia,</hi> and the <hi>fine Linen</hi> of
<hi>Europe:</hi> Which, thou knoweſt, are as different to the Touch, as fine
Paper and Vellum.</p>
               <p>Thou that daily pryeſt into the Faculties of Humane Bodies,
art beſt able to judge, Whether this Man's Excellency, lay in the Tenuity and
Fineneſs of his Skin, the Subtle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of his Spirits, or ſome unuſual
powerful, yet delicate Energy of his Soul; or, whether it conſiſted in all
theſe together.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Derviſe</hi> who was with me, ſeemed not much to
admire at this rare Quality of the Blind Man: Telling me moreover, That about
Ten Years ago, in his Travels, he had ſeen a Blind <hi>Statuary</hi> at
<hi>Florence,</hi> who under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took to make the Reſemblance of an
<hi>Image,</hi> in the Chief <hi>Temple</hi> of that City; which he finiſh'd
ſo much to the Life, that his Work could no otherwiſe be diſtinguiſh'd
from the Original, than by the difference of the Mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials, <hi>that</hi>
being Alabaſter, <hi>his</hi> white Clay; which he ſo temper'd and molded
with his Fingers, as he continually felt of the other, that no Lineament was
left unexpreſs'd.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="37" facs="tcp:99492:30"/>Indeed, when I reflected on our
<hi>Mutes</hi> in the <hi>Seraglio,</hi> and the unaccountable Sagacity with
which they apprehend thoſe Words which they never heard, I ceas'd to be
ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priz'd at what I had ſeen the Blind Man per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form, or what the
<hi>Derviſe</hi> had ſaid of the <hi>Statuary.</hi> I remember in
<hi>Sultan Amurath</hi>'s Time, there was a <hi>Mute,</hi> in whom the
<hi>Grand Signior</hi> took infinite Delight. For, Beſides a Thouſand
pretty Geſtures and Tricks, with which ſhe us'd to divert that
<hi>Prince,</hi> he often made her his <hi>Secretary,</hi> em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploying her in
Writing Letters to his <hi>Baſſa's</hi> and others, whilſt he dictated to
her by Signs. Although ſhe could never receive the Sound of Words, nor utter
any that were articulate; Yet, I have ſeen her tranſcribe a whole
<hi>Chapter</hi> in the <hi>Alcoran,</hi> containing a Hundred and Seventy
<hi>Verſicles,</hi> in as fine a Character, as the moſt celebrated
<hi>Scribes</hi> of the <hi>Empire;</hi> and, when ſhe had done, would
explain what ſhe had thus written, by Signs, which made it evident, that
ſhe perfectly underſtood the <hi>Alcoran.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe are rare Gifts, my Friend; yet, were all the
<hi>Mutes</hi> educated, with as much Diligence and Care as was
<hi>Saqueda</hi> (ſo was ſhe call'd) 'tis poſſible, they would attain
to greater Perfection. I have been told, That her <hi>Tutor,</hi> one of the
Learned'ſt Men in <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabia,</hi> beſtowed Twenty Years in teaching her
this Method of Reading, Underſtanding and Writing.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="38" facs="tcp:99492:31"/>This puts me in Mind of a Man, who was bred
a <hi>Mahometan,</hi> but being taken Captive by the <hi>French,</hi> embrac'd
their Religion, not in his Heart, but only in outward Profeſſion. When I
firſt came to <hi>Paris,</hi> I fell into his Company by Accident, and
underſtanding that he was an <hi>African,</hi> I deſired to ask him ſome
Queſtions; but, he was Deaf, ſo that I had almoſt laid aſide my Hopes
of conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing with him; till perceiving that he mov'd his Lips, and open'd
his Mouth as one that was Talking, I offer'd him Pen, Ink and Paper; making
Signs to him, that I would gladly know his Mind in Writing. He ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly
writ in <hi>Moreſco,</hi> That he was ſtruck Deaf and Dumb about Eighteen
Years ſince; telling me alſo, the Place of his Nativity, and how he came
hither. I took the Pen; and, in the ſame Language, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs'd my
Compaſſion of his Misfortunes. When he ſaw, that I underſtood
<hi>Mereſco,</hi> he writ again, ſignifying to me, That if I open'd my
Mouth wide at the Pronouncing of every Syllable, he could underſtand my
Meaning by the Poſture of my Lips and Tongue. I found his Words true, to my
no ſmall Admiration; for, he would write down what I had ſaid. We convers'd
to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether often; and, at Length I procur'd his Eſcape, in the Retinue of a
<hi>Chiaus,</hi> that was returning from hence to
<hi>Conſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I beſeech the <hi>Wiſe Architect</hi> of <hi>Nature,</hi>
and <hi>Repairer</hi> of <hi>Humane Defects,</hi> either to <pb n="39" facs="tcp:99492:31"/>continue to us the Uſe of our Sences, or to ſupply that Want, by

have happen'd in <hi>Europe</hi> ſince the Beginning of this Year, whereof
the other <hi>Baſſa's</hi> may poſſibly be ignorant.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Diet</hi> of <hi>Francfort,</hi> which had conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
for Three Years, was diſſolv'd on the <pb n="41" facs="tcp:99492:32"/>12th. of the 4th.
<hi>Moon.</hi> This may be known at the <hi>Port,</hi> while they remain
Strangers to the Reaſon of it. There are a Sort of <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians</hi> in
<hi>Germany,</hi> whom they call <hi>Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks.</hi> Theſe are oppoſite
to the <hi>Roman Church,</hi> both in <hi>Religion</hi> and
<hi>Intereſt;</hi> and, their Cauſe is chiefly eſpous'd, by the
<hi>Dukes</hi> of <hi>Saxony</hi> and <hi>Brandenburgh.</hi> It was to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
with theſe, that an <hi>Aſſembly</hi> was appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at
<hi>Oſnaburgh;</hi> but the <hi>Emperour</hi> and the <hi>Catholicks,</hi>
were either for continuing that at <hi>Francfort,</hi> or tranſlating it to
<hi>Munſter.</hi> While the contending Parties, were bicker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and
ſtriving to gain their ſeveral Ends, the <hi>Deputy</hi> of the
<hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> tired out with ſuch intolerable Delays,
depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from <hi>Francfort;</hi> whom, the Reſt of the <hi>Deputies</hi>
follow'd. And, this thou mayſt report, for the true Occaſion of the
<hi>Diſſolution</hi> of that <hi>Diet.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus, at the Beginning of the Year, the Diſputes which theſe
<hi>Infidels</hi> rais'd about Safe Conduct, Exactneſs of Titles, Priority of
Addreſs, and many other vain <hi>Punctilio's,</hi> hinder'd them from coming
to any Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion about a Peace, which was the Principal Cauſe of their
Aſſembling. And, this is a Folly peculiar to the <hi>Nazarens,</hi> That in
all <hi>Publick Aſſemblies,</hi> the very Strength and Vitals of their
Counſels, are ſpent in a vain adjuſting of <hi>empty Ceremonies.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is credibly reported here, That the King of <hi>Poland,</hi>
earneſtly ſollicits a Match with Queen <hi>Chriſtina</hi> of
<hi>Suedeland.</hi> It ſeems, he <pb n="42" facs="tcp:99492:33"/>had formerly ſent an
<hi>Embaſſador</hi> on that Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, to the <hi>Suediſh Court;</hi> but,
he return'd without any poſitive Anſwer, or effecting any Thing in it. In
the Second <hi>Moon</hi> of this Year, that Queen ſent an
<hi>Embaſſador,</hi> to give the King of <hi>Poland</hi> an Account, that
ſhe had taken the <hi>Government</hi> upon Her. While he tarried in the
<hi>Poliſh-Court,</hi> there were not wanting ſuch, as by the King's Order,
ſifted his Inclination, in Reference to this Affair. It was propos'd to him,
That this <hi>Match</hi> would be a happy Occaſion, to Unite the Two
<hi>Kingdoms</hi> in a firm and durable <hi>League;</hi> That the
<hi>Evangelicks</hi> in <hi>Poland,</hi> would be much eas'd thereby; That
<hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ladiſlaus,</hi> was not much decay'd in his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Vigour; That
<hi>Suedeland</hi> might in the mean while, be govern'd by the
<hi>Council.</hi> With many other Propoſals and Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to this
Purpoſe: Among which, I muſt not omit, that it was ſuggeſted, How
eaſie 'twould be for Two ſuch Potent <hi>Crowns</hi> in
<hi>Conjunction,</hi> not only to humble the <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> but alſo to
put a ſtop to the Victori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Arms of the <hi>Ottoman Empire.</hi> But, all
this came to Nothing; that wary Queen ſuſpecting, that there was a deeper
Deſign in the Courtſhip of this Old Fox: And, that by ſuch a
<hi>Match,</hi> the <hi>Kingdom</hi> of <hi>Suedeland,</hi> in Default of the
<hi>Iſſue-Royal,</hi> might be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected to a <hi>Foreign
Crown.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>However, it is eaſie to apprehend from this, That if the
<hi>Poles</hi> maintain at Preſent their Accord with the <hi>Sublime
Port,</hi> 'tis for <pb n="43" facs="tcp:99492:33"/>want of Strength to break it; and, that
they only wait an Opportunity, to make ſome Potent and Firm
<hi>Alliance,</hi> which may ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond the Deſigns formed by that
<hi>Court,</hi> againſt the <hi>Firſt Throne</hi> on <hi>Earth,</hi>
where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of thou art One of the <hi>Principal Pillars.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Remain firm in thy <hi>Station;</hi> and, let neither the
Tempeſts of War, nor the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſions of State, which are the too fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
Products of Peace, ſhake thy Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy. But, above all, ſuffer not thy

Perſecution at thy Hands? It could not <pb n="45" facs="tcp:99492:34"/>be Revenge,
becauſe I never gave thee Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion: unleſs thou ſtill retaineſt a
Grudge, on the Score of my ſtudying in the <hi>Aca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demies;</hi> and, that at

had rather charitably believe, 'twas thy Ambition not thy Malice, which gave
Birth to thoſe Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumnies thou haſt vented againſt me. Thou envieſt me
the Honour of ſerving the <hi>Grand Signior</hi> in this Station, thinking
thy ſelf ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of diſcharging this Office more ſucceſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully than

every Man to be content with his own Condition, ſince <hi>Deſtiny</hi>
diſtributes the Employments of the World among Men, by Rules into which we
cannot penetrate.</p>
               <p>Thou art Maſter of the <hi>French</hi> Tongue; but, doſt
thou think that a complete Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lification for a Man in my Poſt? Art thou fit
to converſe in the <hi>Court</hi> of a <hi>Foreign Prince,</hi> who canſt
not govern thy Tongue in <hi>that</hi> of thy <hi>Native Sovereign?</hi> Thou
art yet to learn a <hi>Courtier's</hi> Maſter-piece, which is, To
diſſemble even the neceſſary Art of Diſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulation. That is, as the
<hi>Arabians</hi> ſay, <hi>To have a Veil upon a Veil;</hi> or, as the
<hi>Italians, To have a Mask with a Natural Face on the Outſide.</hi> Thou
art ſo far from this, that thou canſt not yet draw perfectly the firſt
rough Strokes of a Counterfeit.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="46" facs="tcp:99492:35"/>To ſpeak plain, hadſt thou by an
Artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial feigning of Friendſhip to me, made Way to inſinuate thy Story
into the Belief of the <hi>Grandees,</hi> thou might'ſt have prais'd me to my
Ruine. But, to go bluntly to Work, without preventive <hi>Encomiums,</hi>
diſcover'd at once the Weakneſs of thy Judgment, and the Strength of thy
Paſſion; giving the <hi>Miniſters</hi> Occaſion to think, There was
leſs of Truth, than of Deſign in thy Accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations.</p>
               <p>For the Future I adviſe thee, to mind thy Books and Scholars,
and meddle not with <hi>Mahmut,</hi> whoſe Buſineſs is, to ſtudy Men.

               <p>WITH extream Joy, I have received the certain News of the taking

               <p>I muſt confeſs, when I firſt apprehended the Intentions of
<hi>Sultan Ibrahim,</hi> to make War with the <hi>Republick</hi> of
<hi>Venice,</hi> I was apt <pb n="47" facs="tcp:99492:35"/>to hearken to ſome thinking
Men in this <hi>Court;</hi> who, making their Obſervations, of the
<hi>Sultan</hi>'s indulging himſelf in Female Pleaſures, conjectured from
thence (as by a Common Rule) that he would not have diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered ſuch a
Martial and Active Spirit, in aſſerting the Honour of the <hi>Ottoman
Empire.</hi> His dext'rous concealing his Deſigns, even to the very Execution
of them, has ſtruck a Damp into all the <hi>Courts</hi> in <hi>Europe;</hi>
inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as <hi>Cardinal Mazarini,</hi> this Day told the
<hi>Queen-Regent,</hi> That he doubted, leſt <hi>Sultan Ibrahim</hi> would
prove another <hi>Junius Brutus,</hi> who, being the <hi>Nephew</hi> of
<hi>Tarquin,</hi> One of the <hi>Primitive Kings</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> for
ſome Years, counterfeited an extraordinary Simplicity and Weakneſs of
Spirit: but, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving privately ſecured a Faction to his own Intereſts, by
Popular Arts; he, to gain the <hi>Sovereignty,</hi> chang'd the <hi>Form</hi>
of <hi>Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;</hi> procur'd himſelf to be made <hi>Conſul,</hi> and
diſcovered a <hi>Genius,</hi> ſurpaſſing in Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy and mature
Judgment, all his Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors.</p>
               <p>Though the <hi>Cardinal</hi>'s Compariſon, be
diſproportionate to the <hi>Grandeur</hi> of the <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign Emperor</hi>
of the <hi>World;</hi> who cannot, without a vaſt Injury, be poſt-pon'd in
Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, Wiſdom or Power, as a <hi>Second</hi> or <hi>Imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tator</hi> of any
<hi>Prince</hi> upon <hi>Earth:</hi> Yet, the Character holds good in the Main,
That he has timely and maturely diſſembled, the moſt Sublime Abilities
and Endowments a <hi>Sovereign Prince</hi> is capable of, rend'ring there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by 
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:99492:36"/>by his Enemies ſecure and careleſs; till at length, all
thoſe Illuſtrious Attributes exert themſelves on a ſuddain, breaking
forth like the <hi>Sun</hi> from an <hi>Eclipſe;</hi> at once dazling the
aſtoniſh'd World, and ſurprizing the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of the <hi>Ottoman
Empire,</hi> in the Slumbers which proceeded from the Contempt of his
<hi>Sacred Majeſty.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I thought indeed once, that the <hi>Venetians</hi> would have
been in a Condition to have fac'd the <hi>Ottoman Navy,</hi> and diſputed
their farther Progreſs on the Seas. I expected no leſs, than that they
would have made ſome huf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fing Attempts on the <hi>Iſles</hi> of the
<hi>Archipelago;</hi> that they would have enter'd the <hi>Helleſpont,</hi>
brav'd the <hi>Dardanels,</hi> and ſailing forward, would have block'd up the
<hi>Ottoman Navy</hi> in the <hi>Propontis,</hi> or driven them into the
<hi>Euxine</hi> Sea for Shelter. And, who could have thought otherwiſe, had
they been provided for a War? But, our Sage <hi>Emperor,</hi> by Secrecy, which
is the very Soul of all great Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takings, has anticipated their very Fears,
and leap'd upon the Prey, while the Keepers were aſleep.</p>
               <p>Had the <hi>Chriſtian Princes</hi> and <hi>States,</hi> laid
aſide their Private <hi>Punctilio's</hi> and Animoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, when the
<hi>Venetians</hi> firſt made their Application to them for Aſſiſtance,
it might have prov'd a doubtful War. But, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of generouſly uniting
their Forces in the Common Defence of <hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> they began to
divide their Intereſts and Hearts one from another; and that, upon the
vaineſt <pb n="49" facs="tcp:99492:36"/>Motives in the World; One <hi>State</hi>
diſputing with Another, about Precedency of Poſts in the Army; which
proceeded to that Height, as to fruſtrate the Main Deſign: For, the
<hi>Pope</hi> himſelf at laſt, is forc'd to raiſe the greateſt Aids the
<hi>State</hi> of <hi>Venice</hi> are like to have; joining his Galleys with
theirs, and ſending a Thouſand Foot on Board, at his own Coſt.</p>
               <p>Thus does <hi>Divine Providence,</hi> out of the Diſcords of
<hi>Chriſtian</hi> Princes, draw Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions to enlarge the <hi>Sacred

               </head>
               <p>IT appears, that the <hi>Queen</hi> of <hi>France</hi> is very
Indulgent to her <hi>Generals,</hi> having call'd Home the <hi>Duke</hi> of
<hi>Enguien</hi> from the Toils of War. This <hi>Prinee</hi> neglecting the
Wounds he receiv'd in the Battle of <hi>Aller<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheim,</hi> not many Days
after, fell into a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Fever: So that he was carried in a Horſe-Litter
to <hi>Philipsburgh,</hi> with no ſmall <pb n="50" facs="tcp:99492:37"/>Danger of his
Life. As ſoon as he recover'd his Health, he was commanded to return to
<hi>France,</hi> and the Charge of the whole Army committed to <hi>Mareſchal
Turenne.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Such Tenderneſs is never ſhew'd to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible
<hi>Ottoman Generals,</hi> neither would they eſteem it a Favour, but a
Diſgrace. When they go to the Wars, they make no underhand Leagues with the
Elements to ſpare their Bodies; but, are reſolv'd to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat with Cold,
Heat, Hunger, Thirſt, and all the Hardſhips to which Soldiers are liable,
as well as with the Swords of their Enemies. They take no other Armour
againſt the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous Froſts of a <hi>Ruſſian</hi> Winter, or the
Scorching Sands of a <hi>Perſian</hi> Summer, but an Unſhaken Reſolution,
an Invincible Patience, and a Mind incapable of bowing under the Worſt
Misfortunes. They are not angry with the Weapons of their Adverſaries, when
they carve in their Limbs the Marks of an Honour, which will far outlaſt the
Pain of their Wounds; and, in their Fleſh hew deep Characters, of an Immortal
Fame, and a Renown which ſhall know no Period. They are not parſimonious of
their Blood, but court their Enemies to ſpill it on the Ground, from whence
it will ſpring up in Lawrels and Wreaths, to crown 'em with Triumphs and
Glory whilſt they live, and to ſweeten their Memory with the Praiſe of
Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Generations.</p>
               <p>Thus, Magnanimous <hi>Vizir,</hi> do the <hi>Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulman
Heroes,</hi> the <hi>Props</hi> of the <hi>Firſt Empire,</hi> 
                  <pb n="51" facs="tcp:99492:37"/>manifeſt their Courage, in defying of Dangers and Wounds,
and ſcorning to capitulate with Fortune, for Eaſe and Exemption from Death.
They know, that when they march againſt the <hi>Infidels,</hi> 'tis in
Vindication of the <hi>Eternal <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity:</hi> And therefore, inſtead of
endeavouring to ſhun, they court a Death ſo glorious, as that which will
immediately tranſport them to the <hi>Boſom</hi> of our <hi>Holy
Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet,</hi> and to the <hi>Inexpreſſible Delights</hi> of the
<hi>Gardens</hi> of <hi>Eden.</hi> Where this Truth is firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly rooted, there is
no Room for Fear to plant it ſelf. But, the Caſe is otherwiſe with
<hi>Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels,</hi> who blaſpheme that pureſt <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ndivided
Eſſence.</hi> They aſſert and believe a <hi>Plurality</hi> of
<hi>Gods,</hi> and therefore in Time of Danger, amongſt ſo many
<hi>Deities,</hi> they know not whom to addreſs, or whom to confide in. The
Apprehenſion of Death, is terrible to them, whoſe Hope is only in this
Life; whoſe Conſciences are ſtained with a Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Pollutions, and
yet renounce the very Method of being Clean. Who not only err themſelves, but
by their Evil Example and Influence, (for I ſpeak of the <hi>Princes</hi> and
<hi>Great Ones</hi>) draw Innumerable after them, to taſte of the <hi>Tree
Zacon,</hi> which grows in the <hi>Middle</hi> of <hi>Hell.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>People ſpeak variouſly of the <hi>Duke</hi> of
<hi>Enguien</hi>'s Conduct in the Battel of <hi>Allerſheim.</hi> His
Creatures, extoll his Valour and Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience with <hi>Hyperboles:</hi> Whilſt
his Enemies, endeavour to leſſen his Reputation. Some ſay, he owes his
Revocation to the <hi>Queen</hi>'s <pb n="52" facs="tcp:99492:38"/>Diſlike; Others
attribute it, to the extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Concern ſhe has for his Health. But,
ſuch as would be eſteem'd the Wiſer Sort, ſay, his Return is voluntary
and ſought by himſelf, ſcorning to hold his <hi>Commiſſion</hi> any
longer at the Pleaſure of <hi>Cardinal Mazarini;</hi> who, 'tis thought,
firſt procured him this Employment, only to have him out of the Way, and take
off his Application from the <hi>Domeſtick</hi> Affairs of <hi>France.</hi>
Theſe are the Diſcourſes of the People at preſent, who yet perhaps may
change their Opinions before the Sun goes down. They will always be
cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuring and deſcanting on the Actions of their <hi>Superiors;</hi> few
being willing to think their Tongues were given 'em to lie Idle. It is but a
Little Member, but often does Great Miſchief by its Activity. One of the
<hi>Ancients</hi> gave no good Character of it, when he call'd it a
<hi>Daemon.</hi> Yet, we are not bound to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve all that the
<hi>Philoſophers</hi> ſaid. <hi>Aeſop</hi> gave the moſt impartial
Account of this Member, when he ſaid, <hi>'Twas the</hi> Beſt <hi>and
the</hi> Worſt. Sometimes I ſit ſilent many Hours together; not for Want
of Company; (for, here's a Glut of that in this Populous City) nor, becauſe I
know not what to ſay, (for, I could ſpeak a great Deal more, than 'tis
ſit for others to hear) but, that I may ſtudy with leſs Interruption, how
to ſerve my <hi>Great Maſter.</hi> For, much talking enervates the
Judgment, and evaporates the Mind into Air. Beſides, by thus practiſing
Silence in Private, I learn the Art of reſtraining my <pb n="53" facs="tcp:99492:38"/>Words in Publick, when it is requiſite to promote the Ends at which
I aim. 'Tis not for a Man in my Station, to be open and talkative; but, to
diſtinguiſh Perſons and Seaſons; to underſtand the due Stops and
Advances of my Tongue; ſometimes to ſay Much in a Little, at other Times to
ſay Little or Nothing at all; but, ever ſo to ſpeak, as not to lay my
ſelf naked to the Hearers; yet, to ſeem a very frank, open-hearted Man, in
what I diſcourſe of.</p>
               <p>I would not have thee conclude from what I have ſaid, That
<hi>Mahmut</hi> uſes any Reſerve to the <hi>Miniſters</hi> of the
<hi>Divan,</hi> who are <hi>Mines</hi> of <hi>Science</hi> and
<hi>Wiſdom,</hi> and can eaſily diſcern the Heart through the moſt
artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Veil of Words. But, it is abſolutely neceſſary for me, to
uſe Diſſimulation in this <hi>Court;</hi> ſeeming many Times Ignorant
of what I really know, that I may not be thought to know more than they would
have me. I was never yet ſo indiſcreet, as to publiſh any Secret that was
committed to my Charge; whereby I have gained great Confidence, with Men who
delight to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boſom their Intelligence. They eſteem me a Man of Integrity,
and fit to be truſted. Thus am I made privy to many Intrigues of the
<hi>Grandees,</hi> and a Repoſitory of the <hi>Court</hi>-News: Whilſt they
whiſper in <hi>Mahmut</hi>'s Ear, what is tranſacted in the Royal
Bed-Chambers, and private Apartments.</p>
               <p>By this means, I came acquainted with an Amour of <hi>Cardinal
Mazarini,</hi> which is <pb n="54" facs="tcp:99492:39"/>known but to a few. This
<hi>Miniſter</hi> has none of the Worſt Faces, and a proportionate Elegance
in his Shape: Much addicted alſo to the Love of Women; yet, he manages his
Intrigues with that Caution and Privacy, as not to expoſe the Honour of his
<hi>Function.</hi> Among the Reſt, he had frequent Acceſs to the Chamber of
a certain <hi>Counteſs-Dowager,</hi> her Husband being lately deceas'd. This
was not carried ſo privately, but 'twas whiſper'd about, That a Man was
ſeen often to come out of this Ladies Chamber a little before Day; but, no
Body knew who it was (for, the <hi>Cardinal</hi> went diſguiz'd.) At laſt,
it came to the <hi>Queen</hi>'s Ear, who was reſolv'd to unravel this
Intrigue. She cauſed <hi>Spies</hi> to be placed at a convenient Diſtance
from the Lady's Chamber-Door, which opened in a Gallery of the <hi>Royal
Palace,</hi> with Orders to trace him Home. That Night the deſigned
<hi>Watch</hi> was firſt ſet, it fortun'd, that the <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal</hi>
being in the <hi>Counteſs</hi>'s Chamber, her Maid (who was privy to this
Amour) overheard theſe <hi>Spies,</hi> talking to each other concerning her
Lady; which made her more attentive (being in a Place were ſhe could not be
ſeen) till at length ſhe plainly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered, That they lay in wait to
find out who it was, that had been ſeen coming out of the Chamber. She
quickly acquaints the <hi>Counteſs</hi> with this News. She conſults the
<hi>Cardinal</hi> what was beſt to be done to avoid Diſcovery. In fine, it
was agreed between 'em, That the <hi>Counteſs</hi> ſhould put on the 
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:99492:39"/>
                  <hi>Cardinal</hi>'s Diſguize, and he a Suit of her
Clothes; That ſhe ſhould go out at the uſual Hour of his Retreat, and
walk in the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens; That, if examin'd, ſhe ſhould pretend, This
Diſguize was to guard her from the rude Attempts of Men, who if they found a
Lady alone in the Night-Time, would not fail to offer ſome Incivilities; That
ſoon after her Departure, the <hi>Cardinal</hi> ſhould go forth in her
Dreſs, and ſhift for himſelf. This was perform'd accordingly. The
<hi>Counteſs</hi> walk'd into the Gardens in the <hi>Cardinal</hi>'s
Diſguize, followed by the <hi>Spies,</hi> whilſt he goes to an Intimate
Friend's Houſe, (an <hi>Italian,</hi> whoſe Fortune depended on this
<hi>Miniſter</hi>) and changes his Female Accoutrements, for the proper
Apparel of his Sex. The <hi>Counteſs</hi> having walk'd about half an Hour in
the Garden, was ſeized on by ſome of the <hi>Guards,</hi> under Suſpicion
of ſome ill Deſign. She was carried before the <hi>Queen,</hi> and
examin'd. She then diſcover'd her ſelf, begging the <hi>Queen</hi>'s
Pardon, and telling her, That a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Devotion, had oblig'd her to take
that Courſe for ſeveral Mornings; but, if it offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Her
<hi>Majeſty,</hi> ſhe would hold her ſelf di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpenſed with, and would
forbear. The <hi>Queen</hi> ſeeming ſatisfied with this Anſwer,
diſmiſſed her. Thus, the Amours of the <hi>Cardinal</hi> and the
<hi>Counteſs,</hi> remain'd a Secret; and, there are but Three Perſons
(beſides themſelves) that know any thing of it; among which,
<hi>Mahmut</hi> is one.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="56" facs="tcp:99492:40"/>Thou ſeeſt, <hi>Illuſtrious
Miniſter,</hi> that the Reputation of my Secrecy, has gain'd me the
Confidence of One of the <hi>Cardinal</hi>'s <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vados;</hi> for, I had
this Relation from the <hi>Italian</hi> whom I mentioned, at whoſe Houſe
the <hi>Cardinal</hi> chang'd his Diſguize. I am not without Hopes, by the
prudent Manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of this Diſcovery, to penetrate farther into the
<hi>Court</hi> Intrigues. For, he that told me this Story, conſider'd not,
that he made me thereby, Maſter of his Fortune; and, that it is no longer
ſafe for him, to deny me any Intelligence I require of him. He has put a Key
into my Hand, which will open his Breaſt at my Pleaſure.</p>
               <p>Yet, I need not magiſterially claim Diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries from him,
as the only Conditions, on which he is to expect my Concealing what he has
already diſclos'd. There is a more dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous and ſerviceable Way to become
his <hi>Confeſſor,</hi> without ſuch an ungrateful Inſult; whilſt
with a well acted Candour, I feign a Relation of ſuch Things, as I
ſuſpect, yet cannot be certain are true, till atteſted by himſelf;
profeſſing at the ſame Time, not to believe thoſe pretended Reports I
heard. If I ſhall be ſo happy, as to do any effectual Service to the
<hi>Grand Signior</hi> by this Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, it will anſwer my Ends, and I
ſhall not repent of my Craft.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Mahmut</hi> Salutes thee, <hi>Sovereign Baſſa,</hi> in
the humbleſt Poſture of Adoration, lying proſtrate on the Ground, in
Contemplation of thy Grandeur. Beſeeching <hi>God,</hi> That he

               <p>THOU wilt laugh at the Hypocriſy and Folly of the
<hi>Nazarenes,</hi> when thou ſhalt know the <hi>Articles</hi> agreed upon
between the <hi>Elector</hi> of <hi>Saxony,</hi> and <hi>Knoningſmark,</hi>
one of the <hi>Suediſh Generals,</hi> on the 27th. of the 8th.
<hi>Moon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Suedes</hi> had prevail'd on the Son of the
<hi>Elector,</hi> to intercede with his Father for a <hi>Truce;</hi> but, the
Old <hi>Duke</hi> would not heark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en to any Thing of that Nature, till
<hi>Torſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> gave Orders to the <hi>Suediſh</hi> Army in thoſe
Parts, That they ſhould oppreſs the <hi>Elector</hi>'s Subjects, by
exacting from them unreaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Taxes and Contributions; and, that they
ſhould lay deſolate all the Countries about <hi>Dreſden,</hi> if they
refuſed to pay what was demanded of them. Accordingly they took a Caſtle,
which commanded a large Valley of Meadows and Corn-fields. The <hi>Suedes</hi>
burnt the Corn on the Ground, led away the Peaſants Captives, and
demoliſh'd many Towns and Villages; yet, not without ſome Loſs on their
Side: For, the <hi>Saxons</hi> one Night ſtole upon them while they were
ſecurely ſleeping, and ſlew an Hundred and Twenty, taking above Three
Hundred Priſoners. Thoſe who were left in Poſſeſſion of the
Caſtle, met with no better Fortune; <pb n="60" facs="tcp:99492:42"/>being compell'd in a
few Days, to ſurrender this their new Conqueſt, with Five Enſigns, and a
Hundred and Fifty Priſoners, which were all carried in Triumph to
<hi>Dreſden.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>One would have thought, That theſe Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes ſhould
have confirm'd the <hi>Elector</hi> in the Averſion he had already conceiv'd
for a <hi>Treaty,</hi> that he would rather have purſu'd his good Fortune
with Arms: Eſpecially, when by entering into a private ſeparate
<hi>Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> with the <hi>Suedes,</hi> he muſt needs give a great
Suſpicion to the <hi>Aſſembly</hi> of the <hi>Depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</hi> But, the
Old Duke doated; and, what neither the repeated Solicitations of his Son, nor
the continual Ravages which <hi>General Koningſmark</hi> made in his
Territories, could procure from him, that he granted to the charming
Addreſſes of a Beautiful Lady.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Elector</hi>'s Son adhering much to the
<hi>Suediſh</hi> Intereſt, and finding all other Means ineffectual to
oblige his new Friends; It was agreed upon between him and
<hi>Koningſmark,</hi> That he ſhould at leaſt perſwade his Father to a
<hi>Truce</hi> of a few Days: That during this Ceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation of Arms, the Son
ſhould invite his Father to a Banquet, where <hi>Koningſmark</hi> ſhould
be preſent, with ſome of the Principal <hi>Suedes</hi> in his Army. All
this ſucceeded accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their Wiſhes. The good Old Man conſented to
a Ceſſation of Arms, and to give <hi>Koningſmark</hi> a Meeting at his
Son's Banquet. The <hi>German</hi> Gallantry, and indeed that of all
<hi>North-Europe,</hi> conſiſts much in their Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive Drinking: He
is eſteem'd the moſt <pb n="61" facs="tcp:99492:42"/>polite Man, who can bear moſt
Wine, with leaſt Alteration of his Temper. This they call
<hi>Carouſing.</hi> The Son had provided Plenty of thoſe Wines, which grow
on the Banks of the <hi>Rhine,</hi> eſteem'd the wholſomeſt and moſt
delicious of all theſe Parts. It is not neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to repeat
particularly, their firſt Salutes and Addreſſes: Both Parties ſeem'd
emulous to exceed in Civilities. They fell to their Wine with Freedom and
Mirth, after the Manner of the Country. When in the Midſt of their
Glaſſes, whilſt the Heart of the Old <hi>Duke</hi> was elevated with the
Juice of the Grape, came into the Room a tall Perſonage all in Armour, and
making his Obeiſance to the Company, deliver'd a Letter to <hi>General
Ko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningſmark.</hi> The <hi>General</hi> having receiv'd it, the Stranger was
invited by the <hi>Elector</hi>'s Son to ſit down with them. He was Maſter
of the Feaſt, and onely <hi>Koningſmark</hi> and the Stranger, beſides
himſelf, were privy to the Intrigue.</p>
               <p>The Stranger unbuckling his Helmet, and pulling it off (for, all
the Reſt of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany were uncover'd, it being the Hotteſt Day in all
the <hi>Summer</hi>) diſcover'd a Face and Hair, much like one of thoſe
<hi>Nymphs,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcrib'd by <hi>Poets</hi> and <hi>Painters.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Duke</hi> could not withdraw his Eyes from this
ſurprizing Beauty, nor fix his ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Thoughts: Sometimes it put him in Mind
of <hi>Ganymede,</hi> the diſcarded Minion of <hi>Jupiter;</hi> but,
<hi>Ganymede</hi> was never ſeen in Armour. Then he thought of
<hi>Adonis,</hi> then <pb n="62" facs="tcp:99492:43"/>of the <hi>Babylonian Pyramus,</hi>
the <hi>Indian Atis.</hi> In fine, he run over all the Celebrated Youths of the
<hi>Eaſt,</hi> to match the Beauty of this Il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrious Stranger. He drank
and gaz'd, whilſt his Son and <hi>Koningſmark,</hi> were pleas<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d to ſee the Bait take. From
ruminating on our Sex, he paſs'd to that of Women: And, remembring that in
ſome former Battels be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the <hi>Suedes</hi> and <hi>Germans,</hi>
ſeveral La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies had diſguiſed themſelves in Armour, and followed
<hi>General Torſtenſon</hi> to the Field, he concluded preſently, That
this was ſome beautiful Female of <hi>Suedeland.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Thought, put the Old <hi>Duke</hi> into a pleaſant Fit of
Raillery, yet not without ſome Mixture of Paſſion for this lovely
<hi>Heroine.</hi> There was ſomething ſo peculiarly graceful in all her
Carriage and Addreſs, as charm'd the <hi>Elector</hi>'s Heart. The Women in
thoſe Parts of <hi>Europe,</hi> are not ſo preciſe in their
Converſation with Men, as in the <hi>Eaſt.</hi> And, 'tis a great Point of
Education, ſo to adjuſt the <hi>Punctilio's</hi> of their Deportment, as
neither to appear too open, nor too reſerv'd. This was her Maſterpiece;
for, ſhe ſo equally divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the Parts ſhe was to act, both of a Maid and
a Soldier, that neither entrenched on the other, but ſhe acquitted her ſelf
with exqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite Honour and Gallantry.</p>
               <p>The next Day after the Banquet, the Son renewed his Mediation
for a <hi>Treaty;</hi> but the <hi>Elector</hi> ſeemed cold. All his Thoughts
were buſied in ruminating on his fair Enemy.</p>
               <p>Not to detain thee longer, in Expectation <pb n="63" facs="tcp:99492:43"/>of
the Iſſue; The Love of this young <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zon</hi> had taken ſo deep Root
in his Heart, that he would grant Nothing but for her Sake, neither could he
deny any Thing which ſhe deſired. Thus by this Stratagem, they
accompliſh'd their Aims, and he condeſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to a <hi>Treaty,</hi> after
Fourteen Days Debate on the <hi>Articles:</hi> Of which I here ſend thee a
True and Particular Copy, that thou maiſt find ſome Divertiſement in the
Folly of the <hi>Infidels.</hi> The <hi>Articles</hi> are as follows:</p>
               <q> 
                  <p> THAT it ſhould be lawful for the <hi>Duke</hi> to keep
<hi>due Faith</hi> to the <hi>Emperor;</hi> nor ſhould he be obliged, to
admit any Thing contrary to the <hi>Intereſt</hi> of the
<hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire.</hi>
                  </p> 
                  <p> That the <hi>Elector</hi> ſhould not lend the
<hi>Emperor</hi> above Three Regiments of Horſe, nor ſhould permit him to
raiſe Soldiers in his <hi>Principality.</hi>
                  </p> 
                  <p> That the <hi>Suedes</hi> ſhould have free and ſafe
Paſſage through <hi>Saxony,</hi> provided they came not within Three Miles
of <hi>Dreſden.</hi>
                  </p> 
                  <p> That there ſhould be free Traffick, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the
<hi>Elector</hi>'s Subjects and the <hi>Suedes,</hi> by Land and Water.</p> 
                  <p> That at the End of Three Months, each Party ſhould be obliged
to declare, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they would prolong the <hi>Truce,</hi> or break it
off.</p> 
                  <p> That the <hi>Elector</hi> ſhould again enjoy his Revenues,
except thoſe which were drawn from <hi>Leipſick.</hi> That he ſhould pay
the <pb n="64" facs="tcp:99492:44"/>
                     <hi>Suedes</hi> Eleven Thouſand Rix-Dollars a-Month,
and a certain Quantity of Corn.</p> 
                  <p> That the <hi>Elector</hi> ſhould do Nothing, which might
hinder the Siege of <hi>Magde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh.</hi>
                  </p> 
               </q>
               <p>Theſe <hi>Articles,</hi> at firſt Sight appeared to be
equally favourable to the <hi>Saxons,</hi> as to the <hi>Suedes.</hi> But, in
Reality, they ſerved onely as an Umbrage to deeper Deſigns, which the
<hi>Suedes</hi> had in Agitation. For, this was the Firſt Step to draw the
<hi>Saxon</hi> off from the <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror</hi>'s Party; and
<hi>Torſtenſon</hi> was now ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure, that whilſt the <hi>Suedes</hi>
ruſhed farther into <hi>Germany,</hi> the <hi>Saxons</hi> would not moleſt
them behind.</p>
               <p>For my Part, I neither underſtand the <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy</hi> nor the
<hi>Integrity</hi> of the <hi>Elector,</hi> in ſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing theſe Articles;
nor, how he can recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile the <hi>Firſt</hi> of them, with <hi>any</hi> of
the <hi>Reſt:</hi> To give Safe Conduct, and kind Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the
Enemies of his <hi>Sovereign:</hi> To be obliged not to lend him any more
Aſſiſtance, than his Enemies ſhall allow, nor ſuffer him to raiſe
Forces at his own Charges: To be chea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of his own Revenues, and tamely yield
to pay a Monthly Tribute beſides: To be tyed up from ſuccouring one of the
Principal Towns in his <hi>Principality,</hi> at that Time beſieged by the
<hi>Suedes;</hi> this is a new Method of keeping <hi>due Faith</hi> to
<hi>Sovereigns,</hi> or of obſerving common Prudence for ones ſelf. But,
Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and Wine cauſe a Wiſe Man to ſtumble, as the <hi>Arabians</hi>
ſay. And this Old Prince, <pb n="65" facs="tcp:99492:44"/>is bleſſed in a hopeful
Son, who is not aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to turn <hi>Pimp,</hi> that ſo he may betray his
Father to his Mortal Enemies. But, let the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> proceed in
their Falſhood and Treachery, one againſt another, while every good
<hi>Muſſulman,</hi> proſtrates himſelf <hi>Five Times</hi> a-Day; and
prays in his Integrity, for the Conſummation of that Time, wherein
<hi>God</hi> has determin'd to put a Period to the <hi>Monarchies</hi> of
theſe <hi>Infidels,</hi> and to reduce them to the Faith and Obedience of his
<hi>Holy Law.</hi>

               </head>
               <p>THY Remembrance is as the Dew of the Evening, or the Midnight
Breezes in <hi>Africk,</hi> after the ſcorching Fervors of a Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers Day,
when neither Trees nor Houſes, nor higheſt Mountains afford any Shadow.
Such are the Employments of State, keeping the Mind in as reſtleſs an
Activity, as that which the <hi>Philoſophers</hi> ſay, is the Occaſion of
Heat. Such alſo the Refreſhment I find in thinking on thee, whoſe Soul is
a Manſion of Tranquillity, an <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>mbrella</hi> of Temperance and all
Vertue. Thither I retreat for Reſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, from the Fatigues of Worldly
Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Pardon the bold Acceſs of an humble Slave, who cannot be ſo
happy, as to viſit thee any otherwiſe than by Letters, yet would be
miſerable in the Want of this Privilege.</p>
               <p>Ever ſince I had the Honour to kiſs the Duſt of thy Feet
in that <hi>Sacred Retirement,</hi> I was fill'd with Love and Admiration of
thy Sanctity. Thrice happy are the Neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Shepherds, whoſe Flocks feed
under thy auſpicious Protection. No fierce Lions, nor ravenous Tygers, dare
violate that Sanctuary; <pb n="67" facs="tcp:99492:45"/>or, hunt for Prey within thoſe
Meadows, conſecrated by thy Preſence. That Rich and Flow'ry Vale, was
firſt ſecured, with an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Immunity from Spoil and Rapine, by the
Bleſſing of our <hi>Holy Prophet.</hi> Now that Bleſſing ſeems to be
redoubled by thy Prayers and Abſtinences, who inheriteſt his Spirit as well
as his Abode. 'Twas in that <hi>Holy Cave,</hi> the <hi>Meſſenger</hi> of
<hi>God</hi> faſted for the Space of Three <hi>Moons:</hi> Thy whole Life
there, is one continued Abſtinence. When thou lifteſt up thy Venerable
Hands to Heaven in Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, the Enemies of our <hi>Holy Law</hi> are ſeiz'd
with Fear and Trembling: Thou art the <hi>Guardian Angel</hi> of the
<hi>Ottoman Empire.</hi> Thy Body attenuated with Twenty Years Faſting, is
purified almoſt to <hi>Immortality:</hi> Thou art become a <hi>Denizon</hi>
among the <hi>Spirits.</hi> Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Beaſts of the Earth, nor the Fowls

Table never ſmoak'd with ſlaughter'd Dainties. Every Tree affords thee a
Feaſt, and the Meadows regale thee with a Thouſand harmleſs Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacies.
Thy Thirſt is allay'd with the Cryſtal Streams; and, when thou art
diſpoſed to Banquet, the <hi>Arabian</hi> Sheep ſupply thee with
<hi>Nectar.</hi> Thus, like a prudent Traveller, thou accuſtomeſt thy

               </p>
               <p>Thou art not privy to the Wickedneſs of the Age: That Cell
guards thee from other <pb n="68" facs="tcp:99492:46"/>Mens Vices; while thy incomparable
Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, defends thee from thy own Vertues. Thou art not puffed up with thy
ſublime Perfections. Pride is a Serpent, which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly poiſons the Root
of the faireſt En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowments. But thou haſt cruſh'd this Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent in the
Egg.</p>
               <p>In that Solitude, the <hi>Angel</hi> open'd the Heart of the
<hi>Sent of God,</hi> and took out from thence the <hi>Devil's Seed-Plot.</hi>
When <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homet</hi> awaked (for, this was done while he lay in a

the Effect of his Benediction.</p>
               <p>There is another Happineſs alſo attends thy Retirement: Thou
liveſt free from Cares and Anxieties: Thou committeſt the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Good to
the Conduct of thy Sovereign, and thy Private Welfare, to the Protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of
Providence; neither diſquieted for the one, nor ſollicitous for the other.
Who riſes, and who falls, in the Favour of the <hi>Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan;</hi> who

their Money; whether it be better to remain in the <hi>Seraglio,</hi> or to be
made <hi>Baſſa</hi> of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> are Cares that never moleſt thee.
Thou canſt ſit in that <hi>Sanctuary</hi> of <hi>Peace,</hi> and pity
thoſe whoſe Ambition, and the Love of Glory, has driven into the
<hi>Toils</hi> of <hi>War.</hi> Thou canſt <pb n="69" facs="tcp:99492:46"/>behold with

and their Watchings by Night; their reſtleſs Thoughts, and buſy Actions;
macerated Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, and uneaſie Souls: While with inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fatigable Pains they
purſue meer Shadows, endeavour to graſp the Wind, or ſecure to
themſelves a Bubble, which is no ſooner touched, than it vaniſhes. Thou
in the mean time, art filling thy Mind with ſolid Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and laying up
Poſſeſſions which ſhall never be taken from thee: For, the Soul
carries her Goods along with her, to that <hi>Other</hi> World.</p>
               <p>I often wiſh my ſelf with thee; and, the Remembrance of what
I once enjoy'd in thy Converſation, cannot be effaced by Diſtance of Time
and Place. The farther I am from thee, the more ardently do I long to ſee
thee. But, even in theſe Innocent Deſires, there is neceſſary a
Mortification; ſince, we are not born for our ſelves, but to comply with
the <hi>Myſterious</hi> Ends of <hi>Fate.</hi> I am appointed to ſerve the
<hi>Grand Signior</hi> in this Place: Where I endeavour to acquit my ſelf a
<hi>Faithful Slave,</hi> and a <hi>Good Muſſulman.</hi> If I fail in the
<hi>Firſt,</hi> my <hi>Great Maſter</hi> will puniſh me; if in the

every Frailty, will not be eſteem'd a Tranſgreſſion; ſince the Heart

ſin not in this, ſince it is not required at my Hands.</p>
               <p>Pray for me, <hi>Holy Man</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> that while I aim
at the <hi>Beſt</hi> Things, I may not fall into the <hi>Worſt;</hi> and,

<hi>Proxy.</hi> The greateſt Part of the laſt <hi>Moon,</hi> was ſpent in
Masks, Banquets, and <hi>Court</hi>-Revels, to Honour the
<hi>Eſpouſals</hi> of <pb n="71" facs="tcp:99492:47"/>this New Queen; who is ſince
gone towards <hi>Poland,</hi> being attended to the Frontiers by a numerous
Train of the <hi>Nobility,</hi> with all the Ceremonies and Regard due to a
Perſon of her Rank.</p>
               <p>The <hi>French,</hi> who are never ſparing in Words, are too
liberal in the Praiſes they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow on this Princeſs. For, if all were
true they ſay of her, ſhe might be liſted in the Number of
<hi>Angels:</hi> Whereas, ſome more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial Eyes, have diſcover'd ſuch
Imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, as ſpeak her yet on this Side a <hi>Saint.</hi> But, ordinary
Vertues in <hi>Princes,</hi> dazzle the Multitude; borrowing a greater Luſtre
from the Nobility of their Blood, and the Eminence of their Quality: Whilſt,
their Vices are either ſhrowded from the Vulgar, or made to paſs for
Vertues, in the Artificial Dreſs, which Flatterers put on them. 'Tis under
this Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, the New Queen of <hi>Poland</hi> is cry'd up for a
<hi>Diana;</hi> though a late <hi>Satyriſt,</hi> vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicates her from being
half ſo Cruel as that <hi>Goddeſs:</hi> It being no Secret, That a Young
<hi>Italian Marquis,</hi> had ſomething kinder U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, than had
<hi>Acteon,</hi> when he accidentally encounter'd this Princeſs, as ſhe was
walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing alone one Evening in a Grove belonging to her Palace.</p>
               <p>I am no Patron of Libels; nor would I ſpeak irreverently of
thoſe, whoſe Royal Birth claims Reſpect from all Mortals. But, the
Stupidity of the <hi>Nazarenes</hi> provokes my Pen, who allow their Women all
the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>controulable Freedom and Opportunities, <pb n="72" facs="tcp:99492:48"/>that
commonly give Birth to the moſt irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular Amours, and yet believe 'em
Innocent. They are perfect Idolaters of that Sex; not having learned, with the
illuminated <hi>Muſſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> That Women are of a Creation Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior to
that of Men, have Souls of a lower Stamp, and conſequently more prone to
Vice; and, that they ſhall never have the Honour to be admitted into Our
<hi>Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But thou, who believeſt the Doctrines Clear and Intelligible,
and haſt kiſs'd the Garment of the <hi>Sent</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> wilt not
ſuffer thy Reaſon to be blinded by the Enchant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of theſe deluding
Fair Ones; but ſo love Women, as ſtill to remember thou art a Man, which is
ſomething more Sublime.</p>

               <head>LETTER XVII. To the <hi>Kaimacham.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>IT is hard to gueſs, where the <hi>French</hi> Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries will
terminate. Either Fear, or the Deſire of Novelties, opens the Gates of moſt
Cities to them; and, when that will not do, the Force of their Cannon makes a
Paſſage into the ſtrongeſt Holds of their Enemies, and puts whole
<hi>Provinces</hi> under their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection.</p>
               <p>Their Enemies ſay, That the <hi>French</hi> never beſiege a
Town, but their firſt Aſſaults are made with Bullets of Gold; and, when
that will neither prevail on the <hi>Governour,</hi> nor win a Party, then they
only try the Force of the courſer Metal. Yet, this will appear but a Slander,
if thou conſidereſt a late Action of the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Orleans,</hi>
when he lay down be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Bourburgh.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He had ſcarce finiſh'd his Trenches, when the next Morning
an Arrow was found with a Letter faſtned to it, not far from his Tent. The
Letter was directed to the <hi>Duke,</hi> and ſubſcribed by the
<hi>Governour</hi> of the Town. The Contents of it were, to ſignifie to him,
<hi>That if he would give him Fifty Thouſand Pieces of Gold, and continue him
in his Office, he would the next Night open the Gates, and let in his
Army;</hi> and, <hi>that before Mid-day, he would ſend a Meſſenger to
know his Pleaſure.</hi> 
                  <pb n="74" facs="tcp:99492:49"/>The <hi>Duke</hi> waited the
Arrival of the Meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, who ſeconded what his <hi>Maſter</hi> had
ſaid. But, the Magnanimous <hi>Prince,</hi> in ſtead of accepting his
Offer, ſent him back to his <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter</hi> with this Meſſage,
<hi>That he came not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Town as a</hi> Merchant, <hi>to purchaſe it
at the Price of a needleſs Treaſon; but as a</hi> Soldier, <hi>at the Head
of an Army fluſh'd with continual Victories:</hi> Summoning him forthwith to
ſurrender at Diſcretion, <hi>That being the only Way to experience his
Generoſity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Year has been ſignaliz'd with much Action in
<hi>Flanders, Catalonia</hi> and <hi>Italy.</hi> The Field was ſhared among
many brave <hi>Generals.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Orleans</hi> had the Command of the
Army in <hi>Flanders,</hi> where he took the <hi>Forts</hi> of <hi>Vandreval,
Bourburgh, Link, Drin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ghen, Bethune,</hi> St. <hi>Venant, Guiſca, Lens,
Mardike, Lillers, Mening</hi> and <hi>Armentiers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe Places were won by ſeveral Parties, under the Commands
of the <hi>Mareſchals de Gaſtion, de Rantzan,</hi> and the <hi>Duke</hi> of
<hi>Guize;</hi> who all acted in ſeparate Bodies, under the <hi>Duke</hi> of
<hi>Orleans.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nor was the <hi>Count d' Harcourt</hi> idle in
<hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talonia,</hi> where he ſucceeded in the Charge of the <hi>Mareſchal
de la Mothe.</hi> The firſt Effort of his Arms, was the retaking of
<hi>Agramont,</hi> which the <hi>Spaniards</hi> had ſeiz'd; a ſtrong City,
and which kept a large Part of <hi>Catalonia</hi> in Subjection.</p>
               <p>From hence he marched toward <hi>Roſes,</hi> one of the moſt
Important Places for Strength, under the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> King's Dominions,
and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern'd <pb n="75" facs="tcp:99492:49"/>by an experienced Soldier, who fail'd not to
defend the Place to the laſt Extremes; but, after a Siege of Two
<hi>Moons,</hi> was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell'd to yield for Want of Proviſions.</p>
               <p>After this, the <hi>French General</hi> cut off Seven Hundred
<hi>Spaniards,</hi> who were poſted to hinder his Paſſage over a River.
The next Day, the whole Armies meeting in the Plains of <hi>Liorens,</hi> there
was a furious Encounter; in which, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> loſt Ten Regiments
of Horſe on the Spot; the Reſt threw down their Arms and yielded. The
<hi>Marqueſs</hi> of <hi>Mortare,</hi> one of the <hi>Spaniſh
Generals,</hi> was taken Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive; with other Perſons of Note; among which,
was the <hi>Standard-Bearer</hi> of <hi>Spain.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yet, this was but the Engagement of One <hi>Wing:</hi> For, when
the Other enter'd the Combat, the Slaughter was dreadful. Of the
<hi>Spaniards</hi> were ſlain, Six Thouſand Horſe, and Sixteen Hundred
Foot. And Three and Twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Hundred of them were made Priſoners. The
<hi>French</hi> loſt not above Three Hundred in all, and had but a few
wounded.</p>
               <p>This Battel has brought infinite Glory to the <hi>Count d'
Harcourt.</hi> After which, there happen'd Nothing remarkable in
<hi>Catalonia,</hi> ſave the taking of <hi>Balaguier,</hi> which is like to
end this Years Campagne on that Side.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Prince Thomas</hi> of <hi>Savoy</hi> commanded in
<hi>Italy,</hi> but had no great Number of <hi>French</hi> in his Army, the
<hi>Main Body</hi> being drawn off to ſerve in <hi>Catalonia.</hi> Yet, vexed
to ſee the Succeſs of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who had poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs'd
themſelves of a Strong Caſtle, and <pb n="76" facs="tcp:99492:50"/>kept the Field in a
<hi>Bravado,</hi> as if he were not able to face them; he raiſed ſome
Recruits, and enter'd the <hi>Milanez,</hi> where he took the City and Caſtle
of <hi>Vigevano.</hi> After this, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigning to return into <hi>Piemont,</hi>
he found all the Paſſages block'd up by the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who had a
far greater Army than his. Yet, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming Courage, he attempted to paſs
the River <hi>Moura;</hi> and, the Enemy preſenting themſelves to oppoſe
his Deſign, he gave them Battel, and killed Five Hundred and Threeſcore of
them; among which were Nine Officers of Principal Command and Quality: On his
Side, were loſt Two Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Common Soldiers, and Twelve Officers; among
which, was his Brother, <hi>Prince Mau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice</hi> of <hi>Savoy.</hi> Theſe are
the Chief Actions on that Side. As for <hi>Portugal,</hi> there has happened
Nothing in that Kingdom, worthy of Remark.</p>
               <p>I have in this Letter, Sage Governour of the <hi>Imperial</hi>
City, obſerv'd the Method thou enjoined'ſt me. I have acquainted thee, with
whatſoever has Occurred in the preſent Wars of <hi>France</hi> and
<hi>Spain</hi> during this Year.</p>
               <p>'Tis diſcourſed here, That the <hi>Venetians</hi> will lay
Siege to <hi>Canea</hi> next <hi>Spring,</hi> in Hopes to recover that
Important Place, from the Arms of the Victorious <hi>Ottomans.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Orleans</hi> will be on his March to
<hi>Flanders,</hi> toward the latter End of the next <hi>Moon,</hi> reſolving
to make an early Campagne; being alarm'd with the late Loſs of
<hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyke,</hi> which the <hi>Spaniards</hi> took by Surprize, 
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:99492:50"/>without much Bloodſhed; having not the fourth Part of a
hundred men kill'd on their Side. Whereas, when the <hi>French</hi> took it
from them, it coſt five Thouſand Lives of the beſt Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers the King of
<hi>France</hi> had in his Army.</p>
               <p>The Hour of the Poſt will not permit me to ſay more, than
that I am the humbleſt of thy <hi>Slaves.</hi>

               </head>
               <p>I Will not make Tryal of the Virtue of Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip at this
Time, in the Way that <hi>Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers</hi> propoſe to be uſed between
ſuch as own that Title. I will not complain of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors I undergo, that
ſo by making thy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion ſhare them with me, I may eaſe my ſelf
of a Part. It appears to me a puſillani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous, if not an unjuſt Action, for
a Man to transfer his Sufferings, by diſcovering 'em to his Friend, and
deſignedly throw that upon another, which is ſcarce tolerable to
himſelf.</p>
               <p>I am ſick; and, Cuſtom has rendred this, almoſt as Natural
to me as Health. My Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, is not Proof againſt the envenom'd
Arrows, that are ſhot from the <hi>Stars.</hi> Nor am I Conſtellated, to
reſiſt the Secret Conta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions <pb n="78" facs="tcp:99492:51"/>that lurk in the
<hi>Elements.</hi> The Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bage of the Field languiſhes, when poyſon'd with
Inviſible <hi>Atomes</hi> from above; and, all the Leaves of the Foreſt
wither, when touch'd with the baneful Emiſſions of certain
<hi>Meteors,</hi> or ſcorch'd with the winged Exhalations of the Night. So
our Bodies receive a Thouſand Impreſſions from Things without us, and not
a few Maladies from our ſelves. The very Channel of Life, proves many Times
the Vehicle of Death; while our Lungs ſuck in unwholſome Airs, and our very
Breath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes our Bane. We have Radical Poyſons in our Complexions, which
though they do us no hurt, while we let them lie dormant; yet, once excited by
our Paſſions and Vices, they become noxious and Fatal, hurrying us into the
Chambers of Death, by unaccoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Diſeaſes, and Pains which are under no
<hi>Predicament.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This makes me bear my preſent Diſtemper with an equal Mind,
becauſe I know its Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal, and 'tis not in the Liſt of thoſe Mala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
which have no Name: Whereby I can eaſily calculate its Duration, and almoſt
point to a Day, when I ſhall be well again. For, 'tis in the Number of
thoſe, <hi>Phyſicians</hi> call <hi>Acute;</hi> and, the Anguiſh it
inflicts, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms that <hi>Title.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Take not this for a Complaint; nor, what I am about to ſay,
for a <hi>Paradox,</hi> when I tell thee, That I know not which is greater, my
Pleaſure or Pain during this excruciating <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.</hi> Theſe Affections
border ſo near one up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <pb n="79" facs="tcp:99492:51"/>another, that I find it
difficult to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh 'em. They ſeem to be Inmates to each other, and
blended together in their Roots. Sure I am, they are ſo twiſted and
interwoven in my Conſtitution, That I never felt One without the Other. Every
Man may experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, That his ſtrongeſt Deſires, are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded of
theſe Two Paſſions; and, the very Moment of Fruition it ſelf, cannot
ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate 'em. The Minute of Enjoyment, is but conſecrated to his Loſs,
while the Height of his Joy is the Riſe of his Grief, ſince the
ſmalleſt Particle of Time, cannot diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh the Life and Death of
his Pleaſure.</p>
               <p>Do but reverſe this Contemplation, and apply it to my
Sickneſs, and thou wilt find no Riddle in my Words, when I aſſure thee,
That as the Torment of my <hi>Fever</hi> advances, ſo does my Eaſe.
Pleaſure and Pain, ſit and ſhake Hands in my Heart, embrace and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually
divide its <hi>Syſtole</hi> and <hi>Diaſtole</hi> between 'em.</p>
               <p>Yet I muſt needs own, I am indebted, for this Allay of my
Dolors, to the Preſence of my Mind; which I ſuffer not to be torn from it
ſelf, or carried away by the violent Motion of my agitated Spirits. Were it
not for this, a <hi>Fever</hi> would prove a <hi>Hell</hi> upon <hi>Earth,</hi>
and every <hi>Pulſe</hi> a Tormenting <hi>Fury.</hi> My very Drink (which is
all my Subſiſtence now) would appear but the loathſome Diſtillation of
that <hi>Tree,</hi> whoſe <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>npalatable</hi> and <hi>Scal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Gum,</hi>
is appointed for a <hi>Beverage</hi> to the <hi>Damned.</hi> The ſofteſt
Entertainment of my <pb n="80" facs="tcp:99492:52"/>Bed while awake, would but be a
Tranſlation of the Tortures of <hi>Ixion</hi> and <hi>Syſiphus;</hi> and,
the flattering Intervals of Sleep, would but renew the Sufferings of
<hi>Tantalus.</hi> Whereas now, whether aſleep or awake, my Mind keeping
aloft in her proper Sphere, buſied in the Contemplation and Enjoyment of her
ſelf and Superior Objects, partakes not in the <hi>Fever</hi> of my Body;
but, as if on the cool Top of ſome high Mountain, ſurveys all the Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leys
beneath, without being ſenſible of their raging Heats.</p>
               <p>I owe this Tranquility, in the Midſt of Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily Perturbations,
to the <hi>Examples</hi> of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient <hi>Philoſophers,</hi> which, thou
knoweſt, have far more Influence than <hi>Precepts.</hi> Ever ſince I read,
That <hi>Plotinus</hi> could chaſe away the racking Tortures of the Gout and
Stone, by the ſole Force of his Thought, I daily try'd the Experiment,
ſpurr'd on by Emulation of his Vertue; as judging it ignoble in a
<hi>Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulman,</hi> to give the Palm to a <hi>Pagan</hi> in any Point of
Maſculine Bravery.</p>
               <p>'Tis recorded of the ſame <hi>Philoſopher,</hi> That by the
mere Strength and Majeſty of his Mind, he diſſipated the
<hi>Enchantments</hi> of <hi>Apollonius Tyaneus;</hi> and, the <hi>Infernal
Spirits</hi> confeſs'd, They were baffled by that <hi>Thinking Man.</hi> As
if his Soul were of the Nature of <hi>Meduſa</hi>'s Head, which turned all
into Unactive <hi>Statues,</hi> who did but look on it.</p>
               <p>Surely, great is the Efficacy of Contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation, hinted at in
the <hi>Arabian Proverb,</hi> which ſays, <hi>He that can ſee his own Eyes
with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <pb n="81" facs="tcp:99492:52"/>a Glaſs, ſhall be able to move the Bulls
Horns.</hi> Which Myſterious Expreſſion, is thus interpreted by the
Learned <hi>Avicen.</hi> A <hi>Prophet</hi> or <hi>Spiritual Man,</hi> who
always con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſes within, ſhall have power to ſhake the
<hi>Foundations</hi> of the <hi>Earth.</hi> Which, thou know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, reſts on
the <hi>Horns</hi> of a <hi>Bull,</hi> according to the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of
our <hi>Holy Lawgiver.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I need ſay no more to convince thee, That I am in a
<hi>Fever.</hi> My thus expatiating and running from one Thing to another (when
I thought to have ſaid all in a few Words) will ſatisfie thee what Temper I
am in. Yet, recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting my ſelf with Comfort, That I know my Diſtemper, I
will crave Leave to tell thee a ſhort Story, of a Man who was ſick for many
Years, and yet the ableſt <hi>Phyſicians</hi> in <hi>Paris,</hi> could not
diſcern his <hi>Malady.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Perſon, was an <hi>Officer</hi> of the City; whoſe
Buſineſs 'twas, to arreſt Men that were in Debt. He was obſerv'd, to be
the ſubtleſt of all his Brethren, and the moſt dextrous at plotting
another Man's Ruine. This aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented his Eſtate, and he grew extremely rich.
But, in the One and Fortieth Year of his Age, he was ſeiz'd with an unknown
Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lady, a Diſtemper to which the moſt skilful were Strangers. He
languiſh'd Five Years in a Condition, which mov'd all Men to Pity. 'Twill be
tedious to recount the Symptoms of his Illneſs. At length, he died; and,
accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his own Will, was diſſected. The <hi>Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians</hi> found
all Parts of his Body decay'd and waſted; but, when they came to his Head, 
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:99492:53"/>they were above Meaſure aſtoniſh'd, to ſee a Neſt
of <hi>Serpents</hi> inſtead of Brains. This was concluded by, all to be the
Source of his Diſtemper; and, People deſcant variouſly on it. Some ſay,
'twas a <hi>Judgment</hi> of <hi>God</hi> infli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted on him, for his cruel
Subtlety, in tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panning Men out of their Liberties by a Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Wiles.
Others are of Opinion, That it is a <hi>Natural</hi> Product; it being uſual
in ſome Conſtitutions, for this Sort of Creature to be bred out of their
Vitals. A <hi>Merchant</hi> that had been in <hi>Peru</hi> told me, That in a
<hi>Province</hi> of that <hi>Empire,</hi> there were People, who by drinking
the Water of a certain River, had <hi>Serpents</hi> often engender'd in their
Bowels; That he had ſeen one preſented to the <hi>King</hi> of
<hi>Spain,</hi> which was taken out of a Dead Man's Heart, a Cubit in Length.
He ſaid 'twas of a Crimſon Colour, without Scales or Eyes; neither was it
Venemous. This he aſſerted very ſolemnly, and with Imprecations.</p>
               <p>I tell thee, Dear Friend, if theſe Things be true, who can be
ſure he harbors not ſome ſuch loathſome Inmate in his Body? Yet, I
would not have thee grow Melancholy upon it, and diſturb thy Repoſe. The
Day will come, when we ſhall all be meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morphoſed into <hi>Worms</hi> and
<hi>Serpents</hi> in the <hi>Grave.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the mean while, live thou happily, in the <hi>Favour</hi> of
thy <hi>Sovereign,</hi> in the <hi>Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> of thy <hi>Health,</hi> the
<hi>Vigor</hi> of thy <hi>Senſes;</hi> and, have ſometimes in thy Thoughts,
a Man full of Infirmities, without murmuring, <pb n="83" facs="tcp:99492:53"/>
                  <hi>Mahmut,</hi> that loves his Friend in all Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>

<hi>Sword-Bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er</hi> to his <hi>Highneſs.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>I Wiſh I cou'd time my Letters ſo, as to gratify all the
<hi>Miniſters</hi> of the <hi>Bleſſed Port,</hi> by making each
alternately, the firſt Relator of ſome acceptable News, in the Myſterious
<hi>Divan,</hi> where all humane Events are ſcan'd with Impartial Judgment.
But, every <hi>Moon</hi> does not preſent us with Sieges or Battels; neither
can I receive Intelligence of all remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Events, ſo ſoon as they come
to paſs. What I ſhall now tranſmit to thee, is an Account of what has
been omitted in my <hi>Diſpatches</hi> to the other <hi>Miniſters.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Europe</hi> is a Field, fertile in Rebellions, Tumults
Diſorders and Unnatural Wars. No Part of <hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> which is not
polluted with Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, Perfidies, and Maſſacres; no Corner un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>defiled
with Human Blood. The Son con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpires the Death of him who firſt gave him
his Life. The Brother lays Trains to enſnare the Partner of his Blood, the
Offspring of <pb n="84" facs="tcp:99492:54"/>her that bare himſelf. No Bond of Affection
or Tye of Conſanguinity, is of Force to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain theſe
<hi>Infidels,</hi> from purſuing each other with Malice. Neither has their
Religion any more Influence on their Paſſions, than the <hi>Fables</hi> of
the Ancient <hi>Poets.</hi> In Publick and Private, all Things are govern'd by
Intereſt. Thus, while every Man and every <hi>State,</hi> are onely byaſs'd
by the narrow Principles of Self-preſervation; they abandon the General Good
of <hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> and expoſe it as a Prey to the next daring
Invader.</p>
               <p>There is no Reaſon, that we ſhou'd grieve at this Folly of
the <hi>Nazarenes.</hi> 'Tis from their Impiety and Vices, the Vertue and
Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of the Victorious <hi>Muſſulmans</hi> receives the greater
Luſtre; who are created to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plant theſe <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncircumciſed,</hi>
and inſtruct the Nations which they poſſeſs'd, in the <hi>Faith free
from Blemiſh.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yet, Since the Depredations which the <hi>Suedes</hi> have made
in <hi>Germany</hi> and <hi>Denmark,</hi> the neighbouring <hi>Crowns</hi> and
<hi>States,</hi> not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding their Inſincerity, have ſeemingly
interpoſed their Endeavours, to prevent the worſt Effects of a War, ſo
deſtructive to the Common Intereſt of <hi>Chriſtendom. Deputies</hi> were
ſent from all Parts, to <hi>Munſter</hi> and <hi>Oſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naburgh,</hi> with
Inſtructions from their reſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive <hi>Sovereigns.</hi> They have
ſquander'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way much Time in vain Overtures of <hi>Peace;</hi> whilſt the
<hi>Suedes</hi> daily get Ground on one Side of the <hi>Empire,</hi> and the
<hi>French</hi> are not Unſucceſsful on the other.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="85" facs="tcp:99492:54"/>The Enemies of <hi>France,</hi> ſenſible
that they cannot reduce this <hi>Crown</hi> by open Force, have Recourſe to
Artifice. They endeavour to corrupt her Allies, and inſinuate into the Minds
of the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nited States</hi> of the <hi>Low Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries,</hi> all thoſe
Apprehenſions, which may ſerve to improve the Jealouſie they had alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
conceived of the <hi>French</hi> Neighbourhood. Suggeſting, That the
<hi>Spaniſh Netherlands</hi> are the onely Bar, which ſtops the Armies of
<hi>France</hi> from overrunning <hi>Holland,</hi> and the reſt of the
<hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nited Provinces.</hi> In fine, they have prevail'd on them to enter into
a Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate <hi>Alliance,</hi> and not to treat in Conjunction with the other
<hi>Miniſters</hi> at <hi>Munſter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>On the other Side, The <hi>French</hi> by their <hi>Agents</hi>
in <hi>Holland,</hi> endeavour to unmask the Artifice of the
<hi>Spaniards;</hi> repreſenting, That that they have no other Deſign in
theſe Inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuations, but to breed an Ill Underſtanding between this
<hi>Crown</hi> and the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nited Provinces;</hi> that ſo, by their ill
Offices, in Time Things may come to a Rupture, and the <hi>States</hi> be
depriv'd of the Friendſhip and Protection of <hi>France,</hi> which alone is
able to ſupport that <hi>Commonwealth,</hi> againſt the Pretenſions of
their old Enemies, the <hi>Spaniards.</hi> All <hi>Europe</hi> is
aſtoniſh'd to ſee, that notwithſtanding the utmoſt Condeſcenſions
of the <hi>French Court</hi> to conſerve Peace, yet the <hi>States</hi> led
by their <hi>Ill Deſtiny,</hi> ſhou'd embrace the Propoſals of
<hi>Spain.</hi> This makes a great Impreſſion on all the
<hi>Miniſters</hi> aſſembl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d
at <hi>Munſter</hi> and <hi>Oſna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh,</hi> who now conclude, That the
<hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards</hi> 
                  <pb n="86" facs="tcp:99492:55"/>onely ſeek Occaſions to perpetuate
the War in <hi>Europe;</hi> that whilſt the <hi>Princes</hi> of the
<hi>Empire</hi> are engag'd in a Defence of their Territories, and the
<hi>Suedes</hi> and <hi>French</hi> are buſi'd in purſuing their
Conqueſts, they may pick a Quarrel with their New Friends, whom they have
depriv'd of a more powerful Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection, and reeſtabliſh themſelves in
the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volted Provinces.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Deputies</hi> have had ſeveral Conferences about this
Important Affair; and, the Reſult of their Counſels is, to ſollicit the
<hi>French Court,</hi> to uſe its utmoſt Power, to prevent the ill
Conſequences which this <hi>Separate Treaty</hi> will bring along with
it.</p>
               <p>'Tis diſcours'd here, That <hi>Monſieur de la
Tuillerie,</hi> will be recall'd from the <hi>Court</hi> of <hi>Suedeland;</hi>
being eſteem'd the fitteſt Man, to diſſwade the <hi>Hollanders</hi>
from this New <hi>Alliance;</hi> He having been already em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd in ſeveral
Negotiations with the <hi>States,</hi> and is well vers'd in the Methods of
treating with that Nation.</p>
               <p>This ſome judge to be the Reaſon, of the <hi>Sieur
Chanut</hi>'s being ſent to <hi>Suedeland,</hi> that he may reſide at
<hi>Stockholm,</hi> and continue to act there in the Abſence of <hi>la
Tuil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So nice and delicate is this Affair, that all <hi>France</hi>
cannot afford another Man duely qualify'd, to manage it with any Probability of
Succeſs. If he ſhew not more Candour in this Negotiation, than he did when
he was ſent to mediate a <hi>Peace</hi> between <hi>Suede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> 
                  <pb n="87" facs="tcp:99492:55"/>and <hi>Denmark,</hi> he will receive but ſlender Thanks
at his Return. But, if he ſucceeds, 'tis ſaid, That <hi>Cardinal
Mazarini</hi> has de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, he will merit to be inſtall'd in the
<hi>Order</hi> of the <hi>Holy Spirit.</hi> I have formerly ſpoken of this in
one of my Letters, as the moſt Eminent <hi>Order</hi> of <hi>Knighthood</hi>
in <hi>France.</hi>

               <p>IT is not yet publickly known, what De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns have mov'd this
<hi>Court,</hi> to order a mighty Fleet to be fitted out to Sea. But, it is

aſſiſt the <hi>Venetians</hi> againſt the <hi>Turks.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>People diſcourſe variouſly, according to the Strength or
Weakneſs of their Reaſon; and, Five Days ago, an Old Man went to
<hi>Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal <pb n="88" facs="tcp:99492:56"/>Mazarini,</hi> pretending to ſpeak by
<hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration:</hi> He told him, That 'twas in vain to truſt to their
Winged Caſtles, (ſo he call'd the Ships) the Multitude of their Armies, or
in the Treaſures of their Money; for, a <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree</hi> was ſign'd in
<hi>Heaven,</hi> againſt all the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in <hi>Europe;</hi> That the
<hi>War</hi> was begun <hi>Above,</hi> between the <hi>Potentates</hi> who have
the <hi>Cuſtody</hi> of <hi>Kingdoms</hi> and <hi>Empires;</hi> That they

their Holes, and ſhould flow down like a Torrent from the Mountains of the
<hi>Eaſt,</hi> over-running all <hi>Chriſtendom.</hi> In fine, That
<hi>Germany, France, Italy</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> ſhould be laid
Deſolate, their beautiful Cities ſack'd, and the Inhabitants led into
Captivity; That the <hi>Pope,</hi> with all his <hi>Prieſts,</hi> ſhould be
exterminated; and, that all Nations ſhould embrace <hi>One Law.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They put him in Priſon, but he was found walking next Day in
the Streets. The <hi>Keeper</hi> chain'd him in Irons; but, in the Morning he
was ſtanding at the Gate of the Priſon, preaching to the People. Some
ſay, he is a <hi>Chymiſt,</hi> and has found out the <hi>Maſter
Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret:</hi> Others ſay, he is a <hi>Prophet:</hi> But, moſt judge him to
be a <hi>Magician.</hi> He ſeems now to have loſt his Vigor, not being able
to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſe himſelf from the Chains, which faſten him to the Ground where
he lies. Yet he continues to foretel the Ruine of <hi>Chriſtendom.</hi> 
                  <pb n="89" facs="tcp:99492:56"/>'Tis ſaid, he will be ſent to <hi>Rome,</hi> there to

               </p>
               <p>A <hi>Courier</hi> came to this City laſt Night from
<hi>Suedeland,</hi> who brings Letters from <hi>Monſieur Chanut,</hi> which
ſay, That he has received great Encouragement to hope for the Ships which he
was to buy in <hi>Suedeland.</hi> Thou haſt already heard, that
<hi>Monſieur la Tuillerie, Ambaſſador</hi> from this <hi>Crown</hi> to
Queen <hi>Chriſtina,</hi> was thought the only pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Inſtrument, to
diſſwade the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nited States</hi> of the <hi>Low Countries,</hi> from
entring into a Separate <hi>Treaty</hi> with <hi>Spain;</hi> and that
there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Monſieur Chanut,</hi> was ſent to reſide in his Abſence
at <hi>Stockholm,</hi> to obſerve what paſſes, and to continue the
<hi>Alliance</hi> between the Two <hi>Crowns.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This <hi>Miniſter</hi> arrived in <hi>Suedeland,</hi> the
15th. Day of the <hi>Moon</hi> of <hi>December</hi> in the laſt Year; where
<hi>Monſieur la Tuillerie,</hi> had prepared all Things ready for a ſpeedy
Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch of his Negotiation; having the Day before his Arrival, made known
to that <hi>Court,</hi> the Pleaſure of the King of <hi>France</hi> and the
<hi>Queen-Regent;</hi> whoſe Letters were receiv'd by Queen
<hi>Chriſtina,</hi> with all the Marks of Royal Affection; ſhe telling the
<hi>Ambaſſador,</hi> That ſhe infinitely honoured the Perſons of the
King and the <hi>Queen-Regent;</hi> and, that <pb n="90" facs="tcp:99492:57"/>ſhe would
give them ſuch Proofs of the Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity of her Friendſhip, as would
demonſtrate, That ſhe was ſenſible of her Obligations to them, for what
they had contributed to the good Succeſs of her Affairs: And, that there was
nothing more dear to her, nor more fixed in her Reſolution, than to
conſerve inviola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, the <hi>League</hi> that was between them. She farther
told the <hi>Ambaſſadors,</hi> That it was with no ordinary Complacency
ſhe now beheld Two <hi>Miniſters</hi> of <hi>France</hi> in her
<hi>Court,</hi> after ſhe had been without any for a long time. In fine,
ſhe aſſured them, That whatſoever could be ſpar'd from the
neceſſary Defence and Service of the Kingdom, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Ships, Arms or Men,
ſhould not be wanting to the Aid of the King of <hi>France.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By this thou maiſt perceive, that though the King of
<hi>France</hi> has powerful Armies by <hi>Land,</hi> yet he is defective in
<hi>Naval</hi> Forces: Or, if he has Ships enough to defend his own Realms by
Sea, and to ſerve as Convoys to his Merchants, it muſt be concluded, that
ſome Foreign Expedition is deſign'd, which has put him upon this
extraordinary Method to encreaſe his Fleet.</p>
               <p>I thought it highly neceſſary to acquaint thee with this
Paſſage, that the <hi>Miniſters</hi> of the <hi>Port,</hi> Auguſt and
every Happy, may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult what Meaſures to take with this <hi>Prince,</hi>
if it be true, that he deſigns to break the <hi>League,</hi> which he made
with <hi>Sultan Ibrahim</hi> Four Years ago. There is but little Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to
be repoſed, in the moſt Solemn Oaths <pb n="91" facs="tcp:99492:57"/>of <hi>Chriſtian
Monarchs,</hi> who hold not them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves obliged, to keep <hi>Faith</hi> with
thoſe whom they eſteem <hi>Inſidels;</hi> and, thou knoweſt, that is
the beſt <hi>Title</hi> they can afford the <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervers,</hi> of the
<hi>moſt perfect Law</hi> in the <hi>World.</hi> Yet, the <hi>French,</hi>
among all the Nations of the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> ſeem to bear the
greateſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to the <hi>Ottoman Empire.</hi> But they are
inconſtant, and changeable, which is an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Inſincerity. They are
very prompt and warm in contracting Friendſhips, and as ready to infringe
thoſe Sacred Bonds, on the leaſt Occaſion, eſpecially where Intereſt
and Ambition have the Aſcendant.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Venetian Reſident</hi> at this <hi>Court,</hi> makes
daily Viſits to the <hi>Queen-Regent,</hi> and has frequent Conferences with
<hi>Cardinal Maza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rini.</hi> Many <hi>Couriers</hi> paſs between
<hi>Munſter, Stockholm,</hi> and this City. Yeſterday one ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived from the
<hi>Venetian Ambaſſador</hi> at <hi>Mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,</hi> giving an Account,
That the <hi>Secretary</hi> of that <hi>Embaſſy,</hi> whom he had ſent to
Queen <hi>Chriſtina,</hi> was return'd with the Promiſe of Eight Ships of
<hi>War,</hi> lent by that Queen to the <hi>Republick,</hi> to aſſiſt
them againſt the All<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conquering <hi>Muſſulmans.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It ſeems, as if <hi>Sueden</hi> were become the Common
<hi>Arſenal</hi> of <hi>Europe,</hi> from which the other Kingdoms are
ſupply'd with all the Inſtruments of War. But, what is moſt
ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervable, is, That the <hi>Venetians</hi> obtain'd not this Favour,
without the Mediation of the <hi>French Miniſter</hi> at <hi>Stockholm.</hi>
By which it ſeems evident, That this <hi>Court</hi> has newly entered 
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:99492:58"/>into a Private <hi>League</hi> with the <hi>Republick;</hi>
And, that they Deſign to ſurprize the <hi>Otto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> with ſome
ſudden Enterprize by Sea.</p>
               <p>I ſhall not let a Moment eſcape, which may preſent me with
the leaſt Opportunity, to diſcover what is in the Hearts of theſe
<hi>Infidels.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If thou wilt favour me with thy Inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, I ſhall make
the ſafer Steps. <hi>God,</hi> whoſe Eye penetrates into all Obſcurities,
enlighten us with a Ray of that Wiſdom, which once revealed to his

to ſuperſede the Care of that <hi>Republick,</hi> yet now they turn their
Eyes thither. Their Back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardneſs hitherto, is owing to the Secrecy, with
which our Sage <hi>Emperour</hi> meditated the preſent War. His Counſels
were never whiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per'd out of the <hi>Seraglio,</hi> till the ſame Winds
tranſported the News, which wafted our <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible Fleet</hi> to the

of <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice</hi> with the Eyes of Envy, becauſe of her Preheminence in

Puiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſance, and ſtopp'd our Victorious Armies from overflowing all

Nothing but Defeats.</p>

diſcourſe of a certain <hi>agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal</hi> Character, imprinted in thy Soul,

thy Heart, than Forced <hi>Circumciſion;</hi> and, that thou wilt not Fight

                  <hi>Italy</hi> is a fair Field, yet produces <hi>Darnel</hi> as

General Decay of Learning and Knowledge in theſe <hi>Weſtern</hi> Parts:
Hence the Corruption of Ancient Manners. The Great, the Noble, and the Wiſe,
bowed under the Yoke of their <hi>New Maſters,</hi> learned their Faſhions,
and gloried in their Shame. Their Examples influenc'd the Vulgar; Debauchery
became Modiſh and Authentick: Thus, a General Depravation of priſtine

               <p>Neither has Wickedneſs planted it ſelf one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in

               <p>THE preſent War of <hi>Candy,</hi> is like to render that
<hi>Iſland</hi> as much the Subject of the Worlds Diſcourſe, as it was
formerly famous, for being the <hi>Cradle</hi> of <hi>Jupiter.</hi> In thoſe
Days, it was called <hi>Crete;</hi> much celebrated in the Writings of the
<hi>Greek Poets.</hi> Afterwards, it became a <hi>Province</hi> of the
<hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Empire;</hi> then of the <hi>Grecians;</hi> next, it ſubmitted to
the <hi>Saracens.</hi> But, in the Time of the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Expeditions
in <hi>Paleſtine.</hi> when <hi>Baldwin, Farl</hi> of <hi>Flanders,</hi> was
Crown'd <hi>Emperour</hi> of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> this <hi>Iſland</hi>
came into his Poſſeſſion: Which he gave to a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain valiant Commander
in his Army, a Man of a Noble Deſcent; of whom, the <hi>Venetians</hi>
purchaſed it; and, in their Hands, it has continued ever ſince. But now, in
all Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability, <pb n="101" facs="tcp:99492:62"/>bability, it will be the Prize of
thoſe Arms, which Nothing Sublunary can reſiſt.</p>
               <p>The Poſts from <hi>Italy</hi> and the Sea-Coaſts of this
Kingdom, confirm each other's News; all agreeing, That notwithſtanding the
Utmoſt Efforts of the <hi>Venetians</hi> and <hi>Candiots,</hi> to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Relief of <hi>Canea;</hi> yet, our <hi>General</hi> is got into that Haven,
with vaſt Quantities of Proviſions, and a ſufficient Reinforcement of
Men. They add, That Forty Thouſand of our Soldiers have made a Deſcent in
a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother Part of the <hi>Iſland,</hi> have gain'd the Forts of
<hi>Ciſternes, Colmi,</hi> and <hi>Bicorno,</hi> and were on their March
toward <hi>Suda,</hi> with a Deſign to beſiege that Place. They accuſe
our <hi>General</hi> of barbarous Cruelty, in that he cauſed Five of the
Principal <hi>Noblemen</hi> of that Kingdom, to be put to Death; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they refuſed to betray their Country, or enter into the Intereſts of the
<hi>Grand Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnior.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I muſt confeſs, Magnificent <hi>Aga,</hi> That whatever may
be ſaid in Commendation of this <hi>General</hi>'s Policy, and Fidelity to
his <hi>Maſter;</hi> It is no Argument of the Goodneſs of his
Diſpoſition. I rather admire the Temper of the <hi>Duke</hi> of
<hi>Orleans,</hi> when who <hi>Graveling</hi> was ſurrender'd to him, juſt
as he enter'd the Town, was heard to ſay theſe Words: <hi>Let us endeavour
by Generous Actions, to win the Hearts of all Men; ſo may we hope for a daily
Victory. Let the</hi> French <hi>learn from me, this new Way of Conqueſt, to
ſubdue Men by Mercy and Clemency.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="102" facs="tcp:99492:63"/>Theſe are Heroick Sentiments, and agree
well with the Character of this <hi>Prince,</hi> who is ſaid, Never to have
been the Author of any Man's Death, nor to have revenged himſelf of any
injury: Yet, a valiant Soldier, an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pert Commander, and no bad
Politician.</p>
               <p>It is not hid from the <hi>Court,</hi> with what a matchleſs
Vertue he diſmiſs'd a Gentleman, that was hired to murder him. This
<hi>Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaſſin,</hi> was ſuffered to paſs into the <hi>Duke</hi>'s
Bed-chamber one Morning early, precending Buſineſs of great Moment from the
Queen. As ſcon as the <hi>Duke</hi> caſt his Eyes on him, he ſpoke thus;
<hi>I know thy Bus'neſs, Friend; thou art ſent to take away my Life: What
Hurt have I done thee? It is now in my Power with a Word, to have thee cut in
Pieces before my Face: But, I pardon thee; go thy Way, and ſee my Face no
more.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Gentleman ſtung with his own Guilt, and aſtoniſh'd at
the excellent Nature of this Prince, fell on his Knees, confeſs'd his
Deſign, and who employ'd him: And, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving promis'd eternal Gratitude for
this Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Favour, departed without any other No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice taken of him; and,
fearing to tarry in <hi>France,</hi> entred himſelf into the Service of the
<hi>Spaniſh</hi> King. It was his Fortune after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, to encounter the
<hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Orleans,</hi> in a Battle in <hi>Flanders.</hi> The
<hi>Duke,</hi> at that In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, was oppreſſed with a Crowd of
<hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> who ſurrounded him; and, in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict, he loſt his
Sword. Which this Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman perceiving, nimbly ſtepp'd to him, 
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:99492:63"/>and deliver'd one into the <hi>Duke</hi>'s Hands, ſaying
withal, <hi>Now reap the Fruit of thy for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Clemency. Thou gaveſt me my
Life, now I put thee into a Capacity to defend thy own.</hi> The
<hi>Prince,</hi> by this Means, at length eſcaped the Danger he was in; and,
that Day, the Fortune of War was on his Side. The <hi>French</hi> had a
conſiderable Victory.</p>
               <p>Thou ſeeſt by this, That <hi>Heroick</hi> Actions have
ſomething <hi>Divine</hi> in them, and attract the Favours of
<hi>Heaven.</hi> No Man ever was a Loſer by good Works: For, though he be not
preſently rewarded; yet, in Tract of Time, ſome happy Emergency or other
ariſes, to convince him, <hi>That Vertuous Men are the Darlings of</hi>
Providence.</p>
               <p>Thou that art near the Perſon of the <hi>Grand Signior,</hi>

               <p>I Received thy Letter, as an Argument of the Continuance of that

                  </gap> of ſo wiſe a Prince, preſage thee
a better Fortune, than befell one of thy Name, in the Reign of Sultan
<hi>Achmet</hi> III. who, from a Slave ſold in the Market for Three Sequins,
was advanced to an Honour too weighty for his Vertue; being made <hi>Vizir
Azem,</hi> and <hi>Lord</hi> of the moſt delicious <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces</hi> in
<hi>Aſia.</hi> But, being Ambitious of ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute <hi>Sovereignty,</hi> he

being diſcovered, the Fatal <hi>Firm</hi> was ſign'd, and all his Deſigns
were ſtifled with a Bow-ſtring.</p>
               <p>By this thou maiſt comprehend, how neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary it is for
<hi>Princes,</hi> not to overload any Man with <hi>Dignities,</hi> beyond the
Proportion of his Humility and Faithfulneſs. Yet, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards well placed, give
new Vigor to the Endeavours of a <hi>Slave;</hi> whereas, when good Services
are ſlighted, it does but quench the Ardour, with which they were perform'd.
Few Men are ſo Spiritual, as to do Great and Heroick Things, purely for the
Sake of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Complacency. And, I doubt not, but the <hi>Decii</hi>
themſelves, in ſo freely ſacrificing their Lives for their Country, had
Regard to Humane Glory. Even <hi>Seneca,</hi> whom one would take for the
moſt mortify'd <hi>Stoick</hi> of that Age, by his Writings; yet, is
conceived to have found more Encouragement, in the Treaſures of Gold, with
which <hi>Nero</hi>'s Boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty had fill'd his Coffers, than in all his
<hi>Morals,</hi> of which he had ſuch refin'd Sentiments, and elegant
Expreſſions.</p>
               <p>What I have ſaid, thou haſt Wiſdom e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to apply to thy
Self, without being vain-glorious: Let thoſe whom thou employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt in any
meritorious Services, and who diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge their Truſt well, be encourag'd
with the ſame Proportions of Bounty. Munificence will not only add to thy
Glory, but alſo advance thy Intereſt. Since, thou wilt ever have Occaſion
for thy <hi>Slaves:</hi> And, he who has once taſted thy Liberality, as a
Reward for any Eminent <pb n="106" facs="tcp:99492:65"/>Performance; had he no other
Motive, than the Pleaſure of renewing ſo profitable an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment, will
freely hazard his Life, to ſerve thee in an Extremity.</p>
               <p>This Method thou wilt find of no ſmall Uſe to thee, in the
Wars to which thou art going; where it will be neceſſary for thee, to
recompence the leaſt ſingular Bravery of the meaneſt Soldier, not only
with Applauſe, but with ſome Preferment in the Army. This will not only
prove a Spur to others, but even to the Perſon ſo rewarded; and put him
up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on new Efforts of Courage, to attract the Eyes of his Munificent General.
This will be the Way for thee, in Time, to have an Army compoſed all of
Captains, or Men qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified for ſuch.</p>
               <p>Yet let not this diminiſh the Severity of that Diſcipline,
which is requiſite to retain a proſperous Army in their Obedience. I
coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel thee, to be ſtrict in requiring the leaſt Military Duty; and,
Induſtrious in perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thy own Part, which will be an Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to the

thou wilt be more ſerviceable in a Battel, by thy Counſels and Orders, than

Train for his own Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion.</p>
               <p>Wouldſt thou know <hi>Moroſini</hi>'s Crime, that excites
all this Paſſion? To ſpeak the Truth, it was an Overſight advantageous
to the <hi>Ottomans.</hi> He put out with his whole Fleet to ſea, and left
the Port of <hi>Canea</hi> open. By which means. Three of our Ships got in with
Plenty of Proviſions. So that the Town is now in a Condition to ſuſtain a
long Siege, and the <hi>Venetians</hi> deſpair of ever reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering it. Yet
<hi>Moroſini</hi> has made ſo plauſible an Apology, that the
<hi>Senate</hi> have acquitted him; not judging it conſiſtent either with
Juſtice or their Intereſt, to ſuffer one Miſcarriage, the Effect of a
fair Intention, to out-weigh his numerous Merits and Services. For, the
Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of his thus ſuddenly abandoning the Avenue of that Haven, was, to
chaſe ſome of our Veſſels, then under Sail not many Leagues off; and
the Taking of thoſe Veſſels, on Board of which were Abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of Slaves
juſtifi'd to the <hi>Senate,</hi> the Truth of his Pretenſions. However,
there are not wanting ſuch as ſay, he held a private Correſpondence with
our <hi>General:</hi> Others, That the preſent <hi>Governour</hi> of
<hi>Canea,</hi> had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly taken Captive at Sea a Son of
<hi>Moroſini</hi>'s, whom he now offer'd to reſtore, in caſe he wou'd
withdraw his Ships from before the Haven, <pb n="109" facs="tcp:99492:66"/>for a few Days.
I know not how far this may be credited. But, 'is a certain Truth, That
<hi>Moroſini</hi> has his Son again, and he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended himſelf by pleading,
That he redeem'd him by exchanging a <hi>Mahometan</hi> Captive of Equal
<hi>Quality,</hi> whom he had aboard his Ship.</p>
               <p>And, thou knoweſt, That this Manner of Barter, is lawful in
War. <hi>Adonai</hi> the <hi>Jew,</hi> ſends me this Intelligence; and, I
dare be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve him: For, ſince the Inſtructions I ſent him to
<hi>Genoua,</hi> he has taken Care to aſcertain his Reports. I wiſh it were
as true, That <hi>Moroſini</hi> cou'd be prevail'd on, to accept the
Friendſhips of the <hi>Sublime Port.</hi> But, the Character of that
<hi>General,</hi> gives me no En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement to hope, for ſo fortunate a
Treachery, from his ſevere Vertue.</p>
               <p>However, I will hope and believe, That the <hi>Eternal

the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Arms in <hi>Candy,</hi> and all other Parts, as ſhall

<hi>Mahmut</hi> himſelf, who has droop'd all the <hi>Winter,</hi> now begins
to lift up his Head, and partake in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Reſtauration of all

               <p>If I am capable of gueſſing at the Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of my

freſh Air, in the Place where I lodge. There is a vaſt Difference between
the Streets of <hi>Paris,</hi> and thoſe of <hi>Conſtantinople.</hi> I
ſeem to my ſelf to be buried alive in this cloſe City, where my

in <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> the Gardens are ſo intermix'd 
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:99492:67"/>with Houſes, That it looks like a City in the Midſt of

               <p>Beſides the Impurity of theſe <hi>Infidels,</hi> who empty

ſmelt ſome Miles off; the Uncleanneſs of their Diet, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes in no
ſmall Meaſure to my Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per; being forced either to feed on Fleſh
with the Blood in it, or live on Herbs. They laugh at the Niceneſs of the
<hi>Muſſulmans,</hi> who will eat no Meat, that was knock'd down or
ſtrangled. They ſeem to be greedy of Blood, ſaving it in Veſſels;
and, mixing it with Flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of Wheat, make a certain Bread thereof, which they
devour without the leaſt Squeam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhneſs. A <hi>True Believer,</hi> would

               <p>Now the <hi>Spring</hi> has provided a new Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet wherein

               <p>IT appears, That <hi>France</hi> has ſome extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
Deſign by Sea: When and where 'twill be put in Execution, is not yet known;
but the vaſt Preparations that are making, ſeem to threaten ſome Foreign
Invaſion, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than a Naval Combat: It looks, as if they had an Expedition
in Hand greater than that of <hi>Xerxes;</hi> to make a Bridge over the Ocean,
and join the Separated Parts of the World together. New <hi>Arſenals</hi> are
built, in ſeveral Maritime Towns; and, all the Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts are cut down, to
fill them with Timber for <hi>Ships</hi> of <hi>War:</hi> The Mountains are
left na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked of Trees, and the ſtately Woods are tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planted into the
Havens. An Infinite Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Men, are employ'd in making Cordage, Chains,
Bullets, Anchors, Ordnance, and all other Neceſſaries belonging to a
Navy.</p>
               <p>This is <hi>Cardinal Mazarini</hi>'s Project, under Pretence of
ſetting the Poor of the Kingdom at Work, and disburthening the
<hi>Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth</hi> of Vagabonds and Idle Perſons. But, <hi>Mahmut</hi> is
not placed here, to be amus'd with State-Umbrages. It is evident, that this
<hi>Miniſter</hi> deſigns to render his <hi>Maſter</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable on
<hi>both</hi> Elements. <hi>Agents</hi> are ſent <pb n="114" facs="tcp:99492:69"/>to buy
Ships in all Parts; and, the very Pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſants are forced from the Vineyards and

Sea.</p>
               <p>Laſt <hi>Moon</hi> the <hi>Sieur de Queſne,</hi> was ſent

Negotiation; to remove which, this latter was ſent with freſh
Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions. But, <hi>Monſieur Chanut</hi> rejected him; And, Ten Day

That a more Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent Colleague might be ſent him; in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard, he found it
difficult to treat ſucceſsfully, with a People too much elated with
continual Victories.</p>
               <p>Upon this, the <hi>Court</hi> have ſent a <hi>Courier</hi> to
<hi>Stockholm,</hi> with new Orders; whereby he is forbid to make any farther
Overtures in Order to the Continuance of the <hi>League</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween theſe

Poſture, whilſt the <hi>Suedes</hi> ſeem careleſs to conſerve a

               <p>Theſe Miſunderſtandings, may in a ſhort Time proceed to
a greater Alienation; and, in the End, to an open Rupture. Which has the more
Probability, in that, <hi>General Koningſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark</hi> lately ſtopp'd ſome
<hi>French</hi> Troops in their march, under Pretence of ſeeing their
Paſsports; but really, as 'tis thought, to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt the Soldiers, and

               <p>A <hi>Donai</hi> the <hi>Jew,</hi> has much improv'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
in his late Progreſs through <hi>Italy:</hi> He is grown a perfect
<hi>Statesman;</hi> having found out the Way to penetrate into Secrets, and to
diſpatch Buſineſs without any Noiſe. He may prove very ſerviceable at
<hi>Venice,</hi> during the preſent War of <hi>Candy.</hi> His Acquaintance
in that City, gives him Acceſs to the Cabals of the <hi>Senators;</hi> who
ſpare not, over their Wine, to whiſper the Counſels of the
<hi>State,</hi> and to deſcant on the Meaſures that are taken to defend
that <hi>Republick,</hi> againſt the Invin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible Proweſs of the
<hi>Ottoman</hi> Armies.</p>
               <p>It is publickly known, That they have ſent
<hi>Embaſſadors</hi> to the <hi>Crown</hi> of <hi>Moſcovy,</hi> that of
<hi>Poland,</hi> and to the <hi>Coſſacks;</hi> inviting them to enter into
a <hi>League,</hi> againſt the <hi>Grand Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nior.</hi> But, few are
acquainted with the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate <hi>Treaty</hi> they are making, with the
<hi>Baſſa</hi> of <hi>Aleppo.</hi> We owe this Diſcovery, to the
Diligence and Wit of this <hi>Son</hi> of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> He has drawn the
Secret, from the Mouths of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Eminent <hi>Counſellors</hi> of
<hi>State;</hi> and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures me, That the <hi>Senate</hi> have made ſuch
Propoſals to that <hi>Governour,</hi> as cannot fail of inducing him to
Revolt.</p>
               <p>This may prove of ill Conſequence, if not timely preyented:
The pernicious Example of this <hi>Baſſae,</hi> may incite others to tread
in his <pb n="123" facs="tcp:99492:73"/>Steps, eſpecially his Neighbours of
<hi>Sidon</hi> and <hi>Damaſcus,</hi> who have for a long Time medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated a
Sovereignty, Independent of the <hi>Throne</hi> which firſt eſtabliſh'd
'em in thoſe Charges. Beſides, the ſingle Forces of this
<hi>Baſſa,</hi> will be able to give a powerful Diverſion to the Arms of
the <hi>Empire,</hi> already engag'd in <hi>Candy, Dal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matia,</hi> and other
Parts, by Sea and Land. He ſays, the <hi>Venetians</hi> ſpeak much in
Praiſe of this <hi>Baſſa</hi>'s Juſtice, whereof they relate many
Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples: Among the Reſt, A certain <hi>Cook</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the <hi>Franks</hi>
of that City, was accus'd of dreſſing and ſelling putrify'd Fleſh,
whereby many that eat thereof, were infected with the <hi>Plague.</hi>
Complaint being made of this to the <hi>Baſſa,</hi> he ſends for the
<hi>Cook,</hi> and exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines him about it: He reply'd, That he ſold none but
good and wholſome Meat; for, if it happen'd, That at any Time he was forc'd
to keep any Fleſh in his Houſe above Three Days, he ſo ſeaſon'd it
with Spices and Herbs, as made it very ſavoury, and without any ill
Scent.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Baſſa,</hi> not having Patience to hear any more of
this foetid Apology, commanded his Arms and Legs to be cut off, and the Veins
to be ſeared up: Ordering, that during the ſhort Time he had to live, he
ſhou'd have no other Food, but what was made of his own Limbs.</p>
               <p>They relate one more Paſſage, of a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint that was made
by a Peaſant, whoſe Daughter this <hi>Baſſa</hi>'s onely Son had
raviſh'd: The <hi>Baſſa</hi> compell'd him to marry her with 
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:99492:74"/>this Charge, <hi>Let me hear no more Complaints of thee,
unleſs thou art reſolved to leave me without a Son.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is reported here, That the King of <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia,</hi> has
made a <hi>Peace</hi> with the <hi>Great Mogul;</hi> and that they will both

               </p>
               <p>Here is alſo a <hi>Courier</hi> arriv'd from
<hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeilles,</hi> who brings News of the Revolt of <hi>Cavarra;</hi> the
Inhabitants of that Place, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſhaken off the Obedience they owe to the

<hi>Venetians:</hi> and, that <hi>Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Grimani,</hi> has taken Four Ships
of <hi>Raguſa,</hi> laden with Ammunition for our Army. He adds alſo, That
<hi>Moroſini</hi> has Thirty ſmall Veſſels, beſides Galleys, under
the very Walls of the <hi>Dardanells.</hi> I long ago ſuggeſted to the

or other encourage the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> to perform ſome notable
Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploit in the <hi>Helleſpont.</hi> But, <hi>Mahmut</hi>'s Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel was

                  </hi> Wiſdom. The <hi>Venetians</hi> have a powerful
Fleet; If they block up the <hi>Helle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpont,</hi> and hinder our Ships from
ſailing into the <hi>Archipelago;</hi> and the <hi>Coſſacks,</hi> in the

Thouſand Piracies and Ravages, What will become of the <hi>Imperial</hi>
City? Whence will they provide Suſtenance for ſo many Millions of People,
as inhabit that City and the Parts adjacent?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="125" facs="tcp:99492:74"/>Theſe Things are Worthy of
Conſideration: And thou, who haſt the Care of that <hi>Capital Seat</hi> of
the <hi>Ottoman Empire,</hi> wilt not blame <hi>Mahmut,</hi> for putting thee
in Mind of the Danger which threatens even the <hi>Seraglio</hi> it ſelf at

refer the Reſt to thy Wiſdom. My Letters are all regiſter'd; and if
Affairs ſhou'd ſucceed ill, it will be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted, That <hi>Mahmut,</hi>

frequently viſits me, and truſts me with his Secrets. One Day he convinc'd
me by evident Circumſtances, That <hi>Cardinal Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarini,</hi> was projecting
to give ſome ſecret and ſudden Blow to the <hi>Ottoman Empire,</hi> for
which <hi>Oſmin</hi> ſeems to be concern'd by a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Inclination;
being, as I told thee, born of <hi>Mahometan</hi> Parents. He was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſie,

Inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as I thought moſt proper on this Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion. I ſet my
Thoughts on the Rack, to prevent ſo dire a Miſchief. And, having
premeditated well on this Affair, I pitch'd on a Courſe, which would at once
clear me from the <hi>Cardinal</hi>'s Suſpicion; and, by ſeeming to favour
his Deſigns, would abſolutely over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw them. I went to him boldly one
Day; and being admitted to his <hi>Cloſet,</hi> I thus ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs'd that

unexpected Fate of <hi>Henry</hi> IV. this King's Grand-father, of Eternal
Memory, that hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd him from putting in Execution the ſame Deſign I now
propoſe. And, if <hi>Lewis</hi> XIII. did not proſecute it, 'twas becauſe
he wanted a favourable Juncture. Now, behold, it offers it ſelf: 'Tis in your
Power, <hi>Supreme Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rector</hi> of the <hi>State,</hi> under his
<hi>Majeſty,</hi> to build the <hi>Fortune</hi> of <hi>France</hi> ſo high,

ſubmitting to, this new <hi>Gallick Empire;</hi> then will be the Time to
call the <hi>Otto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> to an Account, for the Ravages and Spoils they have
committed in <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Countries, and to carry Our Arms to the Walls
of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and <pb n="139" facs="tcp:99492:84"/>drive theſe

they have thus long ſtraggled, to ruine the moſt deſirable

<hi>Whole World.</hi>
                  </p> 
                  <p> There is no other Way but this, in my Judgment, to ſtop the
Progreſs of the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Victories. Since it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible, to

Reſolution, and put them into a Capacity, to unite all their Forces, in a War
againſt the <hi>Mahometans.</hi> As for the preſent Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the
<hi>Republick,</hi> if their Loſſes were greater, than they are like to be,
yet they will be inconſiderable, in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon of the mighty Gain which
will afterwards accrue, not only to them, but to all the <hi>Chriſtian</hi>
Nations, by advancing the <hi>French Crown</hi> to that Height of Grandeur,
deſign'd for it by <hi>Fate.</hi> Hitherto the <hi>Chriſtian Princes,</hi>
have only endeavour'd to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply a Remedy to the Part particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly affected;
from whence, if by For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune they chas'd the Diſtemper, it ſoon brake out in
ſome other Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber; <pb n="140" facs="tcp:99492:85"/>Whence it came to paſs, that we
loſt <hi>Province</hi> after <hi>Province,</hi> and the <hi>Turks</hi> are
almoſt gotten into the <hi>Heart</hi> of <hi>Europe.</hi> If therefore, We
de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign to drive them thence, it is neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to follow this Method,
which will be found the only Way, to pluck this Evil up by the Roots.</p> 
                  <p> Go on then, Moſt Prudent and Il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrious <hi>Guardian</hi>
of the <hi>Crown,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin'd to Command the <hi>Earth;</hi> Go on, and
lift up our Great <hi>Maſter,</hi> to the Wreath with which the <hi>Tutelar
Angel</hi> of <hi>Europe,</hi> is ready to environ his <hi>Sacred Temples.</hi>
Let not the <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Deputies</hi> at <hi>Munſter,</hi> any longer amuſe
You with feigned Overtures of <hi>Peace.</hi> But, purſue the Propitious
<hi>Fate</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> which waits to lead Our Armies to Victories,
Triumphs and Glories; and to eſtabliſh a New <hi>Empire</hi> in the
<hi>World,</hi> to which all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions ſhall pay Homage, and fly for

               </q>
               <p>Thou ſeeſt, Illuſtrious and Serene <hi>Vizir,</hi> That I
have us'd much Flattery in this Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs. It is a neceſſary Vice in the
<hi>Court</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> where no <hi>Diogenes</hi> can have
Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. It cannot be expected, That I ſhould diſcover by the
<hi>Cardinal</hi>'s Anſwer, What his <pb n="141" facs="tcp:99492:85"/>Sentiments were of
my Project. He is of a debonair Humour, and will rather feign <hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues</hi>
to commend in another Man, than put him to the Bluſh by mentioning his Real
<hi>Vices.</hi> This is an Effect of his <hi>Natural Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoſition,</hi>
which he is wiſe enough to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove to the <hi>End</hi> of <hi>Policy.</hi>
There being no ſubtiler Artifice to gain a Popular E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem, than by the
Reputation of a Generous Temper.</p>
               <p>However, I think I ſaid Nothing that could juſtly offend
Him, unleſs he were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued with the Incommunicable Gift of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
Hearts. For otherwiſe, at the Worſt, he could but tax me with a Loyal

Impracticable.</p>
               <p>Theſe were ſuch, thou wilt eaſily diſcern, when thou
conſidereſt, That though they appear fair and eaſie in the Attempt, as
the Circumſtances of <hi>Europe</hi> are at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent; yet, the Revolution
of a few <hi>Moons,</hi> may quite change the Face of Affairs; new and

depriv'd of his Eyes by the <hi>Grand Signior</hi>'s Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. I condole the
Calamity of my Friend, yet accuſe not the Juſtice of Him who is
<hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter</hi> of us All. We are <hi>Muſſulmans,</hi> and muſt not
diſpute the <hi>Pleaſure</hi> of <hi>Heaven,</hi> or the <hi>Commands</hi>
of our <hi>Sovereigns.</hi> It is an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their Clemency, when they
retrench their Anger, and ſpare the Lives of their <hi>Slaves.</hi> The
<hi>Sultan</hi> is merciful in a higher Degree, in not extending his Hands to
the Wealth of our Friend; but, has left that, and his Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty untouch'd:
Whereby he is ſtill in a Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, of enjoying many Pleaſures, which are
denied to Thouſands who have their Sight.</p>
               <p>I do not write this, as if I were void of Compaſſion toward
my Friend. I owe him ſtill the ſame Affection, as when he was able to read
the Sincerity of it in my Face. But, I would not have the Loſs of his Eyes,
abate the Sight of his Soul, which is his Reaſon. Let him remember, That a
Famous <hi>Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher</hi> has done that voluntarily to himſelf, for the
Sake of a leſs interrupted Contemplation, <pb n="144" facs="tcp:99492:87"/>which is
impoſed on our Friend as a Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. There is no outward Diſaſter,
can hurt the Opticks of a Mind guarded with Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, and ſhut up within the
Circle of its own Light. Such a Soul, is impregnable a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all the
Aſſaults of <hi>Fortune,</hi> and triumphs over <hi>Deſtiny</hi> it
ſelf.</p>
               <p>Beſides, our beloved <hi>Eunuch,</hi> can ſtill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe
with his Friends; which is a Privilege, the <hi>Deaf</hi> would almoſt give
their <hi>Eyes</hi> to enjoy. It is hard to determine, which of thoſe Two
<hi>Sences</hi> would be miſs'd with leaſt Regret; eſpecially, to a Man,
who by his excellent Voice, and Skill in <hi>Singing,</hi> ſeems to be the
very <hi>Soul</hi> of <hi>Muſick.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What is it in all this infinite Variety of Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Objects,
that affects the Eye with ſo refin'd a Pleaſure, but the harmonious
Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition and Symmetry of the Parts, which compoſe the whole Scene of
the Univerſe? And, may not that Pleaſure be tranſlated to the Ear, when
it receives the proportionate Meaſures, and exquiſite Cadencies of Sounds?
Certainly, <hi>Muſick</hi> is no other, than Beauty to the Ear, as Beauty is
Muſick to the Eye.</p>
               <p>But our Friend <hi>Egry,</hi> needs not theſe En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements:
He underſtands the Way to make himſelf Happy, and has Wiſdom e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to
put it in Practice.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Grand Signior</hi>'s Fury is pacified. <hi>Egry</hi>
Lives. He has Houſes and Gardens; Gardens repleniſhed with all Manner of
Fruits and Flowers to gratify his <hi>Taſte</hi> and <hi>Smell.</hi> He is
Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of much Treaſure in Silver and Gold, and <pb n="145" facs="tcp:99492:87"/>of
many Slaves. If all theſe cannot contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute to his Felicity, he is
<hi>Maſter</hi> of <hi>Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,</hi> which is <hi>Eſſential
Happineſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thou who ſucceedeſt him in that honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Poſt, and
guardeſt the Avenue of the <hi>Majeſtick Chamber,</hi> where the
Addreſſes and Supplications of all the <hi>Princes</hi> of the Earth are
made at the Feet of our <hi>Auguſt Emperor;</hi> watch thy Sences, and obey
thy Reaſon. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member thy <hi>Predeceſſor</hi>'s <hi>Fate,</hi> and

letting a Word eſcape my Pen, which might ſpeak leſs Reſignation to the

               <p>But, with thee I dare uſe greater Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom: My long Experience

was it not the Blindneſs of <hi>Sultan Ibrahim</hi>'s Paſſion, which has
robb'd <hi>Egry</hi> of his Sight? Anſwer me without Diſguize; Was it not
ſome Caprice of Jealouſie? Was it not becauſe the <hi>Maſter</hi>

tell thee, <pb n="147" facs="tcp:99492:88"/>though I approve not the licentious Tongues of
theſe <hi>Infidels;</hi> yet, it appears too true, That ſo uncontroulable a
Power as the <hi>Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtern Monarchs</hi> are inveſted with, prompts them to
commit many Violences, for which, Juſtice can make no Plea. It were to be
wiſh'd, That the Practices of the <hi>Sublime Seraglio,</hi> did not too
often verifie it. Suffer me to be exaſperated a little, for the Cruel
Sentence executed on my Friend, the moſt accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh'd Perſon within the
Walls of that <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnificent Palace.</hi> Doubtleſs, he owes the Loſs of
his Eyes, to the Grudge of ſome En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious Minion, who could not brook ſo
dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous a Rival in the <hi>Sultan</hi>'s Favour. For, this Unfortunate
<hi>Eunuch,</hi> who charm'd all Hearts, had made ſome Impreſſion alſo
on the Cruel <hi>Ibrahim</hi>'s. He often lov'd to hear him ſing the lively
<hi>Dorick</hi> Strains, to chaſe away his Melancholy: For, <hi>Egry</hi> is
a Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond <hi>Orpheus,</hi> whoſe Voice, thou knoweſt, inſpir'd the Trees
and Rocks with Paſſion. Beſides, he has many other Gifts, which ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd
his Perſon and Converſation delectable to all; and taught the whole
<hi>Seraglio,</hi> new Leſſons of <hi>Platonick</hi> Love.</p>
               <p>When thou haſt receiv'd this, I deſire thee, to give him a

and give him a Kiſs of Faithful Friendſhip. For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get not alſo to return

Rigorous a Seaſon. It was the Firſt <hi>Moon,</hi> and the Ground was

Theſe Early Marches, make a great Noiſe. But, little of Action could be

               <p>In this, the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Policy deſerves Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation;
who would not expoſe the Health and Lives of their Soldiers to
unne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary Rigors, but waited till the <hi>Sun</hi> had well dry'd up the
unwholſome Damps of the Earth, and ſhedding his benigner Influence through

               <p>The Action of a <hi>French</hi> Officer, was wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of Remark;
who being ſent from the Camp, with Letters to the King and Queen, arrived at

<hi>It became not him to lie in a Bed of Down, when his</hi> General, <hi>with

cauſing ſome Straw to be brought out of the Stables, he took his Repoſe

               <p>THY Letter is come to my Hands, with the Preſent of

brought<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt it thy ſelf from the <hi>Valley</hi> of <hi>Admoim,</hi> the
Place of my Nativity. It is an evident Sign, that thou haſt not forgot thy
Countryman, in that thou condeſcendeſt to oblige him in ſo peculiar a
Manner. The Place where we drew our firſt Breath, is always dear to Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals;
and, the Remembrance of that delicious Vale, affects <hi>Mahmut</hi> with
ſingular Delight. 'Tis true indeed, I was brought from thence, before I could
diſtinguiſh one Place from another; but, I have viſited that Region
ſince, and have Reaſon to pronounce it, the moſt Delectable Part of
<hi>Arabia.</hi> Had the <hi>Grecian Poets</hi> ſeen that

<pb n="151" facs="tcp:99492:90"/>
                  <hi>Tempe</hi> in <hi>Theſſaly.</hi> This Happy Vale,

Spring.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thou art highly oblig'd to the <hi>Sultan,</hi> for the Liberty
he has given thee to viſit the Place of thy Cradle, and to ſojourn ſo
long among thy Kindred. Thy Father was famous in that Country, for hunting of
<hi>Lions,</hi> and other <hi>Beaſts</hi> of <hi>Prey.</hi> I have heard
ſome of our <hi>Tribe,</hi> praiſe his Valour and Dexterity, in the Chaſe
of thoſe Fierce Animals. They told me, That in the Space of Two Years, he had
preſented the <hi>Beglerbeg</hi> with Twenty <hi>Lions</hi> Heads, kill'd by
his own Hand: That he had Three Tame ones in his Houſe, which he had taken
when Whelps from a <hi>Lioneſs</hi> of prodigious Bulk: That the Walls of his
Houſe were hung with the Skins of <hi>Tygers, Panthers</hi> and
<hi>Lions,</hi> the Trophies of his Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fatigable Diligence, Skill and
Courage, in Purſuit of Wild Beaſts. In a Word, they ſaid, he was the
moſt ſucceſsful Hunter in all <hi>Arabia.</hi> If thou inheriteſt his
<hi>Inclinations</hi> as well as his <hi>Blood,</hi> (for, they commonly go
together) thou haſt had a fair Time, to range the Foreſts, and purge the
<hi>Deſart</hi> of thoſe Ravenous Creatures. Were it not for the Enmity of
the <hi>Gnats,</hi> the <hi>Eaſt</hi> would be over-run with theſe Savages.
They ſay, this little deſpicable <hi>Inſect,</hi> deſtroys more
<hi>Lions,</hi> than all the <hi>Huntſmen</hi> in <hi>Aſia.</hi> For,
ſwarm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about them in the Heat of <hi>Summer,</hi> they chiefly faſten on
their Eye-Lids; which they ſting ſo vehemently, that the <hi>Lions</hi>
think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <pb n="152" facs="tcp:99492:91"/>to eaſe themſelves by ſcratching, often
tear their own Eyes out, and ſo are fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh'd.</p>
               <p>To underſtand well the different Natures of Beaſts, is a
Study fit for Kings. 'Twas the Glory of <hi>Solomon,</hi> to be accurate in
this Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge: And, <hi>Alexander the Great,</hi> had ſuch an Eſteem for
it, that he beſtowed on <hi>Ariſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle</hi> the <hi>Philoſopher,</hi>
Eight Hundred Talents, only for writing a <hi>Treatiſe</hi> of
<hi>Animals.</hi> Our <hi>Holy Prophet</hi> was eminent above all other
Mortals, for his Familiarity with the Brutal Generations; underſtanding their
Qualities and Language, and often diſcourſing with them. When he lived in
the <hi>Deſart,</hi> a <hi>Lib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bard</hi> continually waited at the Door of
his <hi>Cave,</hi> and did all the Offices of a kind and faithful Servant. Such
Grace is given but to a few.</p>
               <p>But, I forget my own Opportunity, of venting my Affection to my
Country and my Friends. I forget, that I am writing to one, who is newly come
from <hi>Arabia.</hi> Would to <hi>God</hi> I could ſee thee, were it but for
an Hour: I have a Thouſand Queſtions to ask about my <hi>Relations;</hi>

               <p>THE taking of <hi>Retimo</hi> in <hi>Candy,</hi> has fill'd the

Portents, and Superſtitious Preſages of their approaching Ruine. So hard a
Thing it is, to judge of Human Events, without being carried into Extreams.
They already give over the whole <hi>Iſland</hi> for loſt. I wiſh and
believe it may prove true. Yet, at the ſame Time, I know the Fortune of War

               <p>But, that which appear'd moſt Ominous to their Cauſe, though

being ſeconded with equal Wiſdom and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct; and, that though he was
prone to undertake Great and Hazardous Actions, yet he never had the good
Fortune to accompliſh any Thing of Moment.</p>
               <p>They that know this Gentleman's Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter, ſay, That any

Praiſes that are due, to an expert <hi>Leader</hi> among the

ſame Sentiments long. Every Circulation of their Blood, begets new
Friendſhips, new Opinions, new Cenſures. In this, they ſeem to inherit
the Vices of the Ancient <hi>Gauls,</hi> as well as their Country.</p>
               <p>A <hi>Roman Emperour,</hi> who made War in this Nation, has left
excellent <hi>Memoirs</hi> behind him; wherein among other Things, he

<hi>Diſpoſitions,</hi> and <hi>Genial</hi> Inclinations. He that ſhall
read his <hi>Writings,</hi> which were penn'd above Sixteen Hundred Years ago,

conclude, That the <hi>Latter</hi> are a Living Tranſcript of the

               </p>
               <p>Wilt thou know then, how they obtain ſo many Signal Victories?
It is by Stratagems and Money. Where they cannot circumvent their Enemies, they
corrupt a Party of 'em with Bribes and Penſions. Thus they purchaſe their
Conqueſts, with a more powerful Metal than Steel. The Force of Gold, to which
all Things yield, lays <hi>Cities</hi> and <hi>Provinces,</hi> at the Feet of

conſider, it was not haſtily compos'd; every <hi>Verſicle,</hi> being the
Product of <hi>Divine</hi> Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meditation. Doubtleſs, it excells all the

               <p>Thou wilt ſay, My Station requires me to read Men more than
Books, being not ſent hither to Contemplate, but to act for the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt
of my <hi>Maſter,</hi> and the <hi>Ottoman Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire.</hi> 
                  <pb n="159" facs="tcp:99492:94"/>'Tis true, my Buſineſs is now to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ravel the Deſigns of the
<hi>Infidels;</hi> but, bear with me, if I tell thee, That in Order to this, I
took no wrong Courſe, when in my Young<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Years, I apply'd my ſelf to
Books, which are but Men turn'd Inſide out, or Metamor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phos'd into Letters;
againſt who, thus ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viving themſelves, the Stroke of Death cannot

               <p>Thoſe who have erected Statues of Gold, Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, Braſs or

<hi>Effigies</hi> of their Bodies to Poſterity; which, thou know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, is
the Ignobler Part of Man: And here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, they come ſhort of the
<hi>Aegyptians,</hi> who have the Art of preſerving the Bodies them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
Incorruptible, for a Thouſand Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. But they who left their
<hi>Writings</hi> to Poſterity, have oblig'd the World with an Immortal and
Lively Image of their Mind: This is properly the Man, and lives for ever; when
the Body is conſum'd in the Grave, and the Statue perhaps is eat up by Time,
or demoliſh'd by Envy.</p>

cannot comprehend it in a few Words. It has been enjoyn'd by our <hi>Holy
Doctors,</hi> That a <hi>Muſſulman</hi> ſhould not read the
<hi>Books</hi> of <hi>Prophane Infidels.</hi> But tell me, thou who art the
<hi>Reſolver</hi> of <hi>Doubts,</hi> Whether this <hi>Precept</hi> is
extended to all, without Excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; or, Whether a <hi>Diſpenſation</hi>
may not be allow'd, to ſuch as read thoſe <hi>Books</hi> with One 
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:99492:95"/>Eye, whilſt the Other is fix'd on the <hi>Law,</hi>
which balances the Mind with Truth? The <hi>Alcoran</hi> tells us, That the
<hi>Devil</hi> has inſerted ſome <hi>Falſities</hi> in the <hi>Beſt
Writings:</hi> But, is it not poſſible for a Man, to ſeparate the
<hi>Good</hi> from the <hi>Bad?</hi> I read in the <hi>Book</hi> of
<hi>Glory,</hi> many remarkable Things concerning <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the
Great:</hi> But, is it unlawful alſo to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſe what has been writ by
others, of the <hi>Life</hi> of that <hi>Famous Warriour,</hi> and <hi>Holy
Prophet?</hi> Both <hi>Grecian</hi> and <hi>Roman Hiſtorians,</hi> have
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated his Adventures in <hi>Aſia,</hi> his Battels with <hi>Darius</hi>
the <hi>Perſian Monarch,</hi> and <hi>Porus</hi> the <hi>Indian.</hi> They
praiſe his Continence and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt Regard to <hi>Syſigambis</hi> and her
Daughters, when they were his Captives; his Inviolable Friendſhip to
<hi>Epheſtion,</hi> whilſt living, and the affectionate Tears he ſhed for
him, after his Death. Yet, they condemn him of cruel Ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, for
ſacrificing <hi>Clitus</hi> to his Choler, and the Fumes of Wine, who was a
Faithful Friend, a Valiant Soldier, and once had ſaved his Life in a Battel.
They cannot paſs over the Burning of <hi>Perſepolis,</hi> without ſome
Reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons on the unmanly Softneſs of this Warriour; who, to pleaſe his
Concubine, gave Orders, that the Faireſt and moſt Magnificent City in
<hi>Aſia,</hi> ſhou'd be ſet on Fire. The <hi>Perſians</hi> boaſt,
That that City was built all of <hi>Cedar;</hi> That <hi>Cyrus</hi> had wholly

in Emulation of <hi>Solomon,</hi> King of the <hi>Jews,</hi> who was by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther 
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:99492:95"/>Princes thought to value himſelf too high, for building
the <hi>Temple</hi> at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> of the ſame Materials. They add,
That <hi>Alexander</hi> found in this City, Ninety Millions of Caracl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">

over, and the Flames had conſum'd to Aſhes this <hi>Phoenix</hi> of
<hi>Aſia,</hi> the <hi>Conquerour</hi> wept, and commanded the Mony he had
found there, ſhould be expended in raiſing Another in its Room, more
glorious than the Former; but, That <hi>Thais,</hi> who had perſwaded him to
ruine it, was the onely Obſtacle to its Re-edification. For, ſuch was her
Empire over this <hi>Monarch,</hi> That he could deny her Nothing.</p>
               <p>What I have ſaid of <hi>Perſepolis,</hi> is recorded by
<hi>Perſian Hiſtorians;</hi> Other Writers make ſome Mention of it, but
not ſo particularly. There are ſome alſo, who mention his demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing
of <hi>Tyrus;</hi> a City ſo Ancient, That 'tis ſaid to be firſt built by
one of the <hi>Grand-children</hi> of <hi>Noah;</hi> of whom, thou knoweſt,
the <hi>Alcoran</hi> ſpeaks often. They tax him al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo with Cruelty, in
cauſing Two Thouſand of the Chief <hi>Tyrians,</hi> to be crucified, as a
<hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice</hi> to <hi>Hercules.</hi> Thou art beſt able to Judge,
Whether this be agreeable to Truth; for, what <hi>Muſſulman</hi> will
believe, That the Victorious <hi>Prophet,</hi> was guilty of ſo Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous an
<hi>Idolatry.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Method he took to ſubdue this Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pregnable City, is an
Argument of his Invin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible Courage; and, that there is Nothing Impracticable,

                  <hi>Tyrus</hi> was ſituated above Half a

(for, 'twas a perfect <hi>Iſland</hi>) and to their Diſtance from the Shore

attempted, without the <hi>Miracle</hi> of <hi>Moſes,</hi> to make a Path for
his Army through the Sea. He follow'd the Steps of the <hi>Babylonian
Monarch,</hi> who, not Three A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges before, had joyned this Proud Neſt of

Fire and Sword, after a Siege of Six <hi>Moons,</hi> he ſcal'd the Walls of

This Paſſage the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> ridicule, ſaying, That the Sun

reproach Him with Luxury. Had he been acquainted with the <hi>Fable</hi> of

               <p>A <hi>Courier</hi> came to this City laſt Night, bringing News
of the Taking of <hi>Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray</hi> by the <hi>French</hi> Army. This is a
conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Town in <hi>Flanders,</hi> and commands a great part of the
Country. The <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Orleans,</hi> inveſted it on the Ninth of
the laſt <hi>Moon;</hi> and on the Eighteenth, lay down before it with the
whole Army. The <hi>Spaniſh Generals,</hi> haſten'd to its Relief, and
brought Thirty Thouſand Men of Six Nations, to combat with the
<hi>French.</hi> But they quarrel'd about Precedency of Poſt. High Words
paſs'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Lorrain</hi> and <hi>General
Lam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boy.</hi> Thus, while they ſpent their Time in Needleſs Conteſts, the

Part of the Army, commanded by the <hi>Mareſchal de Grammont,</hi> is marched
to joyn the <hi>Hollan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi> with Deſign to attack <hi>Antwerp;</hi> and

               <head>LETTER X. To the <hi>Aga</hi> of the
<hi>Janizaries.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>I Perceive thou haſt follow'd the Advice I formerly gave thee,
to read <hi>Hiſtories;</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in thy Letter ſpeaks thee very
Converſant. Thou wilt have no Reaſon to repent of a Labour, that affords
ſo agreeable a Diverſion, eſpecially to a <hi>Soldier</hi> and a
<hi>Stateſman.</hi> They open the Graves, and call forth the Dead, without
diſturbing their Repoſe; and preſent to us thoſe <hi>Heroes</hi>
living, talking and acting Great Things, whoſe Bodies have lain buried in
Silence and Obſcurity many Ages. They introduce us into the Cloſets of
<hi>Princes,</hi> revealing their moſt Secret Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels. They make us
familiar with the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trigues</hi> of <hi>Politicians,</hi> and the
<hi>Stratagems.</hi> of <hi>Warriours.</hi> In fine, there is Nothing Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
or Private, in the <hi>Courts</hi> or <hi>Camps</hi> of the Greateſt
<hi>Monarchs,</hi> to which an <hi>Hiſtorian</hi> is a Stranger.</p>
               <p>I applaud the Choice thou haſt made of <hi>Grecian
Hiſtories,</hi> and others of the <hi>Eaſt;</hi> 
                  <pb n="170" facs="tcp:99492:100"/>yet,
I counſel thee, not to neglect thoſe of the <hi>Weſt.</hi> The Ancient
<hi>Roman</hi> Writers, are full of rare Examples; and Modern <hi>France,</hi>
which emulates all Great and Glorious Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takings, takes equal Care to commit
to Poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, the <hi>Lives</hi> of Illuſtrious Perſons. I ſay not
this, in Contempt of other Countries in <hi>Europe.</hi> The
<hi>Chriſtians</hi> of theſe Parts in Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, are accurate
<hi>Hiſtorians.</hi> They are u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſally Learned; in Regard, there is no
Kingdom in <hi>Europe,</hi> where they have not <hi>Schools</hi> and
<hi>Academies,</hi> where all <hi>Languages</hi> and <hi>Sciences</hi> are
taught. The Ploughmen in the Field, ſpeak <hi>Latin</hi> and <hi>Greek;</hi>
which, thou knoweſt, are now grown obſolete, and no where to be learn'd but
in <hi>Books.</hi> The <hi>Mechanicks</hi> are <hi>Philoſophers;</hi> and,
every Man ſets up for an <hi>Hiſtorian,</hi> or an <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quary.</hi> It
was not ſo in former Times, when the <hi>Eccleſiaſticks</hi> had
engroſs'd all Manner of <hi>Learning</hi> to themſelves, except ſome few
of the <hi>Nobility</hi> and <hi>Gentry,</hi> who had the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of
<hi>Patrimonial</hi> Libraries, and Lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to apply themſelves to Study.
For, then it was difficult to purchaſe <hi>Books,</hi> there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but few;
and, for thoſe they were obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, to the Labour of the <hi>Scribe.</hi>
Hence it came to paſs, That onely ſuch as had Plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Mony, and a
ſtrong Inclination to Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, monopoliz'd the choiceſt
<hi>Manuſcripts</hi> into their Hands, and bequeath'd them as a Legacy to
their <hi>Off-ſpring.</hi> But, ſince the Invention of <hi>Printing,
Books</hi> are infinitely multiply'd, grown Cheap and Common. And, 
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:99492:100"/>thoſe <hi>Hiſtories</hi> and <hi>Sciences,</hi> which
before were ſhut up in the <hi>Latin, Greek,</hi> or ſome of the
<hi>Oriental Languages,</hi> are now tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into the Vulgar
<hi>Speech</hi> of every Nation; whereby the loweſt Sort of People who can
but read, have the Privilege to become as Knowing as their <hi>Superiors,</hi>
and the <hi>Slave</hi> may vye for Learning with his <hi>Sovereign.</hi> This
makes the <hi>Nazarenes,</hi> upbraid the <hi>True Faithful</hi> with Ignorance
and Barbariſm, becauſe <hi>Printing</hi> is not ſuffered throughout the
<hi>Muſſulman Empire.</hi> They conſider not, the <hi>bad</hi>
Conſequences of this <hi>Art,</hi> as well as the <hi>good:</hi> And, that
the Liberty of the <hi>Preſs,</hi> has fill'd the World with Errors and Lyes.
Beſides, they are Strangers to the Education of the <hi>Muſſulmans,</hi>
who are generally taught the <hi>Arabick</hi> and <hi>Perſian Tongues</hi>
from their Childhood: In which Two <hi>Languages,</hi> how many famous
<hi>Hiſtories</hi> have been writ? There is no Point of uſeful Wiſdom,
which is not compriz'd in the <hi>Writings</hi> of the <hi>Eaſtern</hi>
Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges. And, as for unprofitable Treatiſes and Pamphlets, with which the
<hi>Europeans</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound, they are ſuperfluous and burdenſome, bringing a
double Loſs, both to Writer and Reader; while they rob them of their Time and
Mony, and commit a Rape on their Underſtandings. Add to this, the Fatal
Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects which this deprav'd Indulgence of <hi>Print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> has produc'd in
<hi>Chriſtendom.</hi> What Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crileges, Maſſacres, Rebellions and
Impieties, have overflow'd moſt Parts of the <hi>Weſt</hi> in this
licentious Age? What Hatred among <pb n="172" facs="tcp:99492:101"/>
                  <hi>Chriſtians,</hi>
What Seditions among Subjects, Diverſities in Religion, Contempts of all
<hi>Law</hi> both <hi>Divine, Natural,</hi> and thoſe of <hi>Nations?</hi>
The Vices, at which former Times would have bluſh'd; nay, at the very naming
of which, our <hi>Fathers</hi> would have ſtarted, as at a <hi>Prodigy,</hi>
are in theſe Day committed openly, without Shame, without Contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction;
whilſt there are Authors, who dare publickly aſſert the Cauſe of
Impiety, and patronize all Manner of Prophanations.</p>
               <p>But thou, who haſt the Honour to guard the <hi>Incorruptible
Seat</hi> of <hi>Juſtice</hi> and <hi>Vertue,</hi> the Bright <hi>Throne</hi>
of the <hi>Oſman Emperours,</hi> who are the <hi>Shadows</hi> of <hi>God</hi>
on <hi>Earth;</hi> haſt made ſuch a Choice of <hi>Books,</hi> as commends
thy Wiſdom, and the Sincerity of thy Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals. Thou wilt not ſuffer thy
Imagination to be tainted, with thoſe enchanting <hi>Idea's</hi> of Evil,
which are drawn by the Pens of ſome Elegant <hi>Writers.</hi> All that thou
ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt in <hi>Books,</hi> is to inform thy Underſtanding, rectify thy
Judgment, and enflame thy Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions with the Love of Vertue. To this End,
ſerve the <hi>Divine Precepts</hi> of our <hi>Holy Doctors,</hi> and other
Learned Sages; the <hi>Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings</hi> of <hi>Philoſophers,</hi> and the
Examples of Renowned <hi>Heroes.</hi> From theſe thou gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Strength,
to practiſe the Four <hi>Maternal</hi> Vertues, and all the Good Qualities,
that ſpring from thoſe <hi>Roots.</hi>

               <p>I Had forgot to perform in my other Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, what thou
commandedſt me. Yet, knowing the Eſteem thou haſt for <hi>Women</hi> of

<hi>Stories;</hi> I ſhould never ſend any <hi>Diſpatch</hi> to thee,
wherein there is not a Relation of ſome <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roine.</hi> I will be more

and will endeavour, to procure a Collection of the <hi>Lives</hi> and
<hi>Characters</hi> of all the <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Women,</hi> that have been Recorded
in <hi>Hiſtory.</hi> In the mean while, hear what the <hi>French</hi> ſay,
of <hi>Chriſtina</hi> Queen of <hi>Suedeland,</hi> of whom thou requireſt a
Deſcription.</p>
               <p>She is the onely Daughter of <hi>Guſtavus A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolphus,</hi> 
                  <pb n="174" facs="tcp:99492:102"/>the moſt Victorious <hi>Prince,</hi> that ever govern'd
that Nation; and, one of the moſt Succeſsful <hi>Warriours</hi> in the
World. As his whole Life was led in the Field, ſo there he received an
Honourable Death, being ſlain in the Battel of <hi>Lutzen:</hi> Some ſay,
by the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery of <hi>Duke Albert;</hi> who had in Appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, deſerted
the <hi>Emperour,</hi> and offer'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a <hi>Voluntier</hi> to
<hi>Guſtavus Adolphus.</hi> I for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly mention'd this <hi>Duke,</hi> and
that he was kill'd by a <hi>Suediſh Lady.</hi> If the Suſpicion of the
<hi>Suedes</hi> be well grounded, and that <hi>Duke Albert</hi> was really
Guilty of the Murder of <hi>Guſtavus,</hi> it may be, This was the Motive
which brought thoſe <hi>Amazons</hi> into the Field, to revenge the Death of
their <hi>Prince.</hi> But, it is impoſſible to be aſſur'd of the
Truth, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong ſo many different Opinions.</p>
               <p>When the <hi>French</hi> ſpeak of <hi>Guſtavus
Adol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phus,</hi> they cannot reſtrain their Words on this Side a
<hi>Panegyrick.</hi> They ſay, he was a <hi>Prince</hi> above all Praiſe.
'Tis certain, his very Enemies admir'd his unimitable Courage, and matchleſs
Fortune. I have ſent thee the true <hi>Effigies</hi> of his Face, wherein
thou wilt ſee, a moſt agreeable Mixture of Majeſty and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nignity,
creating Reſpect and Love at the ſame Time in the Beholders. He was ſo
fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar with every one, as if he had forgot himſelf, as well as he was a
Stranger to Pride. He was a great Student in his Youth, and made himſelf
Maſter of <hi>Latin, French,</hi> and <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian;</hi> being alſo
perfectly skill'd, in Ancient and Modern <hi>Hiſtories.</hi> He had a
wonderful Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, <pb n="175" facs="tcp:99492:102"/>in diſcovering Impoſtures; a
dextrous Wit in Time of Danger and Difficulty, being Ready at Counſel, and
ſwift in Execution; and, as cunning at a Stratagem, as he was bold at an
Onſet. He was Liberal to his Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, and to all Men of Merit; but, a
ſevere Puniſher of Diſorders in his Army. And, that which Crown'd all the
reſt of his Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, his Piety to <hi>God</hi> was ſingular and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of
Remark. The <hi>French</hi> relate a Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable <hi>Saying</hi> of this King,
when he was once in his Camp before <hi>Werben.</hi> He had been ſolitary in
the Cabinet of his Pavilion ſome Hours together, and none of his Attendants
durſt interrupt Him; Till at Length, a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite of his having ſome
important Matter to tell him, came ſoftly to the Door, and looking in, beheld
the King very devoutly on his Knees at <hi>Prayers.</hi> Fearing to moleſt
him in that <hi>Sacred</hi> Exerciſe, he was about to withdraw his Head, when
the King ſpied him, and bid Him come in, ſaying unto him, <hi>Thou
wondereſt to ſee me in this Poſture, ſince I have ſo many Thouſands
of</hi> Subjects <hi>to pray for me. But, I tell thee, That no Man has more
Need to pray for Himſelf, than He, who being to render an Account of his
Actions to None but</hi> God, <hi>is for that Reaſon, more cloſely
aſſaulted by the</hi> Devil, <hi>than all other Men beſide.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Guſtavus</hi> was born in the Year 1594. At which Time,
they ſay, a <hi>Comet</hi> was ſeen in the <hi>Form</hi> of a
<hi>Sword,</hi> with its Point dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted toward <hi>Germany;</hi> which the
<hi>Aſtrologers</hi> 
                  <pb n="176" facs="tcp:99492:103"/>of thoſe Times, interpreted as a
Preſage of that King's Warlike <hi>Genius,</hi> and of his fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
Conqueſts in the <hi>Empire.</hi> He came to the Government, before he had
ſeen full Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venteen <hi>Winters,</hi> and was cut off in the Eighth and
Thirtieth Year of his Age.</p>
               <p>It is ſaid, That a few Days before his Death, when his
Soldiers received Him with Infinite Acclamations, and all the Marks of an
unuſual and intemperate Joy, he ſeemed to be troubled at it, ſaying,
<hi>That he took that Exceſſive Demonſtration of his Soldiers Love, for
an</hi> Omen, <hi>of ſome approaching Diſaſter; And, that he was
aſſured,</hi> God <hi>would, by ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king him away, teach them, That there is
no Confidence to be repos'd in any</hi> Mortal.</p>
               <p>After the Death of <hi>Guſtavus,</hi> the <hi>States</hi> of
the <hi>Kingdom</hi> aſſembling, proclaimed <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtina</hi> Queen;
And, during her <hi>Minority,</hi> committed her to the <hi>Tutelage</hi> of
Five Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal <hi>Officers</hi> of the <hi>Kingdom,</hi> who alſo took on
them, the whole Care of the <hi>Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>She is perfect in Seven <hi>Languages.</hi> Well vers'd in
Ancient and Modern <hi>Philoſophy;</hi> And, a complete <hi>Hiſtorian.</hi>
In fine, ſhe has acquired the <hi>Title,</hi> of the <hi>Moſt Learned
Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of her Time.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>She is of a Graceful and Majeſtick Aſpect: Has a piercing
Eye: Wears Part of her Hair looſe about her Temples, and flowing down in
Curls to her Shoulders; the Reſt braided up behind, in Form of a Wreath. Thus
is ſhe repreſented by her <hi>Picture,</hi> which I have 
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:99492:103"/>ſeen in a Gallery of <hi>Cardinal Mazarim</hi>'s
Palace, who profeſſes a great Veneration for this Queen. Could I have
purchas'd her <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traicture,</hi> as I did her Father's, I would have
ſent it thee: But, all the Pencils in <hi>Paris</hi> are hardly ſufficient,
to ſupply the Cloſets and Galleries of the <hi>Nobles,</hi> with this
Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired <hi>Figure.</hi> She is become the <hi>Idol</hi> of the
<hi>French.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Many great <hi>Matches</hi> have been offered her; but, ſhe
refuſes all, either for Reaſons of <hi>State,</hi> or Diſlike of the
Perſons, or an Averſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſhe has for a <hi>Married</hi> Life; or through
Oppoſition of her <hi>Nobles,</hi> who ſeem to covet to be governed by a
<hi>Maiden Queen.</hi> Soon after her Father's Death, the King of
<hi>Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark</hi> attempted to make her his Wife; but his Redreſs was
abruptly rejected.</p>
               <p>No better Encouragement did the King of <hi>Poland</hi> lately
meet with, who Twice ſollici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the ſame Thing for Himſelf, and was as
often repulſed. But this, 'tis thought, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded from ſome Politick
Reaſons; he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing deſcended of <hi>Sigiſmund,</hi> a former
<hi>Abdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated</hi> King of <hi>Sueden;</hi> all whoſe <hi>Poſterity,</hi>
are for ever excluded from enjoying the <hi>Suediſh Crown,</hi> by a Law.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Engliſh</hi> alſo gloried in a <hi>Virgin
Queen,</hi> the laſt Age: Her Name was <hi>Elizabeth;</hi> whom thou can'ſt
not but have heard of. She was the Daughter of <hi>Henry</hi> VIII. King of
that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. She was a <hi>Princeſs</hi> of an extraordinary
<hi>Genius,</hi> remarkable for her Wit and Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. 'Twas one of her
Subjects, who, the <pb n="178" facs="tcp:99492:104"/>firſt of all Mortals, ſail'd round
the <hi>Globe:</hi> And, by his fortunate Service, ſhe vanquiſh'd the
reputed <hi>Invincible Armada</hi> of <hi>Spain.</hi> She governed her Kingdom
with ſuch exquiſite Conduct, as made the Greateſt <hi>Potentates</hi>
revere her Wiſdom. 'Tis to her Bounty, the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nited Provinces</hi> owe
the Riſe of their preſent Grandeur and Riches; when they addreſs'd this
Potent Queen in Form of Humble Suppliants, entitling themſelves, <hi>The poor
diſtreſſed States.</hi> But now, they're <hi>High</hi> and
<hi>Mighty;</hi> puſhing for an Equality with <hi>Sovereign</hi> Princes,</p>
               <p>I cannot comprize in a Letter, all that may be ſaid of this
Great Queen. Beſides, <hi>Hiſtorians</hi> vary in her Character. Thoſe
that ſpeak moſt Impartially, ſay, That ſhe had Extraordinary
<hi>Vertues,</hi> yet was not free from Great <hi>Vices.</hi> We muſt not
expect in any Mortal, a Temper exempt from the Common Malediction; much leſs
in that <hi>Sex,</hi> whoſe Natural Weakneſs, claims our Indulgence and
Excuſe. It is admirable to ſee, or hear of a <hi>Female,</hi> whoſe
Active Soul can diſingage it ſelf from the Common Frail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of
<hi>Women,</hi> and perform Things ſcarce be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the Power of
<hi>Maſculine</hi> Vertue.</p>
               <p>If thou thinkeſt my Letter too tedious, accuſe thy ſelf,
for commanding me to write of Perſons, whoſe Uncommon Gifts and
Tranſcendent Vertues, the moſt Accurate <hi>Hiſtorians</hi> can but

<hi>Fame</hi> will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jure, in not being capable to tranſmit them to

<hi>Aleppo.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THOU telleſt me a Tragical Story of One of thy <hi>Wives,</hi>
That ſhe is become a Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitive, and gone away with thy <hi>Slave
Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renzo;</hi> whom I remember to have ſeen at thy Houſe at
<hi>Conſtantinople.</hi> Either thou wert too Unkind to them both, or
gaveſt 'em both too much Liberty: Whichſoever of theſe Ways thou haſt
exceeded, thou art in the Fault. Too great an Indulgence, either to a Wife or a
Servant, makes them pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuous: And, too great Severity, hardens them to
Deſpair. However, ſince it is ſo, I adviſe thee to comfort thy ſelf
with this Thought, That thou art rid of <hi>Two Evils.</hi> Had they prov'd
Faithful, they would not have merited that <hi>Title;</hi> but now, they are
neither worthy of thy Grief, nor of thy Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge.</p>
               <p>But, if thou art reſolv'd to purſue them, ask not my
Counſel, or Aſſiſtance in this Place; where I ſhould have as much
Reaſon to apprehend Danger, as they. 'Tis true, I know thy <hi>Slave;</hi>
but, were I to meet him in the Streets of this City, I ſhould be very
unwilling, by diſcovering him, to be made known my ſelf. Beſides, thy
Paſſion has <pb n="183" facs="tcp:99492:106"/>made thee forget, That the
<hi>Nazarenes</hi> would commend his Wit, and rejoice in his For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune; who
being a <hi>Slave</hi> to one, whom they eſteem an <hi>Infidel,</hi> has now
by his Wiſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, purchas'd both his Liberty and a Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful Mate, with
no ſmall Treaſure.</p>
               <p>I rather adviſe thee, to apply thy ſelf to <hi>Jaſmir
Sgire Rugial,</hi> the Little <hi>Aſtrologer</hi> in <hi>Aleppo,</hi> who
perhaps may tell thee ſome News of 'em. There is not a Star in the Eighth
Sphere, can ſtir without his being privy to it. And, he pretends to behold in
their Motions, whatever is done on Earth.</p>
               <p>But, to be ſerious, thy <hi>Slave</hi> was an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful
Fellow, thus to abuſe all thy Favours. Thou hadſt made him in a Manner,
Maſter of all thy Riches, only reſerving thy <hi>Wives</hi> to thy ſelf.
And, if the Deſire of Liberty tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted him to eſcape, he ought in Juſtice
to have ſacrific'd his Luſt, to the Regards he ow'd thee. But, every
<hi>Slave</hi> is not a <hi>Joſeph. Lorenzo</hi>'s Villainy, puts me in Mind
of the Continence of an <hi>Italian Marquis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Young <hi>Lord,</hi> fell in Love with a
<hi>Dutcheſs</hi> of ſingular Beauty, but knew not how to make her
ſenſible of it. At length, <hi>Fortune</hi> favour'd him with an
Opportunity, beyond his Expectation. One Evening, as he return'd from Hawking,
he paſs'd through the Fields of that <hi>Dutcheſs,</hi> bordering on the
<hi>Palace.</hi> The <hi>Duke</hi> her Husband and ſhe, were walking
together, as the Young <hi>Lord</hi> came by. The <hi>Duke</hi> ſeeing his
Train, and what Game they had been at, ask'd him <pb n="184" facs="tcp:99492:107"/>ſome
Queſtions concerning their Sport; and being of an Hoſpitable
Diſpoſition, invited him into his Palace to take a Collation. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
could be more agreeable to the Young Lover. He accepted the Offer; and here
com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menc'd an Acquaintance, which made Way in Time for an Aſſignation
between the <hi>Dutcheſs</hi> and Him. He was let into the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens one
Night, and ſo conducted privately to her Chamber, where ſhe lay ready in
Bed to receive Him. After ſome Compliments, the <hi>Dutcheſs</hi> ſaid,
<hi>My Lord, You are obliged to my Husband for this Favour; who, as ſoon as
you were gone from our Houſe, the firſt Time we ſaw you, gave you ſuch
Commendations, as made me conceive an immediate Paſſion for you. Is it
true, Madam?</hi> (replied the Young Lover already half undreſs'd) <hi>Then
far be it from me, to be ſo ungrateful to my Friend.</hi> With that he put on
his Garments again, and took his Leave.</p>
               <p>But, it cannot be expected, that ſo much Vertue ſhould be
found in a <hi>Slave.</hi> I would not have thee vex thy ſelf, for what
cannot be recover'd. Adieu.</p>

               <p>THIS Day <hi>Paris</hi> makes a Figure like An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
<hi>Rome,</hi> when that <hi>Miſtreſs</hi> of the <hi>World</hi> honour'd
her <hi>Generals</hi> with Publick Triumphs, at their Return from the
Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer'd Nations. The Streets are hung with Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſtry, and ſtrew'd with
Lawrels: The Shops are ſhut up. The Young Men and Virgins, are cloathed in
their beſt Array. They walk up and down in Conſorts, ſinging the
<hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Enguien</hi>'s Praiſe: Whilſt the Old and Decrepid,
ſit at their Doors, to ſee the <hi>Hero</hi> make his Entry, and rehearſe
the <hi>Memoirs</hi> of their former Years. With Tears of Joy, they heap
Bleſſings on the Victorious Youth, as he rides along: And, throwing their
Age and Crutches by for a while, they conſecrate the Reſt of the Day to the
Publick <hi>Jubilee.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Wouldſt thou know the Occaſion of all this Joy? 'Tis to
welcom this <hi>Prince</hi> Home from the Succeſsful Toils of War. For, let
his Courage and Conduct be what it will, if he had made a fruitleſs Campagne,
his Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment had been different. But, <hi>Fortune</hi> has been
propitious to him; and, the happy Event of his Arms, crowns him with

               <p>His firſt Attempt was, on a Place of no great Strength, called
<hi>Furnes,</hi> which he took with Eaſe. Then he marched to
<hi>Dunkirk,</hi> one of the Strongeſt Towns in <hi>Europe.</hi> There was in
it at that Time, a Garriſon of Five and Twenty Hundred Foot, and Three
Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Horſe, commanded by a <hi>Nobleman</hi> of great Valour. I think
they call him the <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis de Leide.</hi> This <hi>Governour</hi> did ſo
many brave Things, in Defence of this Place, as even ſurpaſs'd his own
Fame, and the Expectations of others; though, both were very Great. Yet at
Length, he was forced to yield to the Courage and Fortune of the Young
<hi>Duke;</hi> and that, at a Time, when the other <hi>Spaniſh Generals</hi>
were coming to his Relief. The Town was ſurrendred, on the 7th. of this
<hi>Moon.</hi> And, the <hi>Duke</hi> having left the Neceſſary Commands to
the <hi>Mareſchals</hi> his Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants, is come Home to receive the
Accla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations of the People, the Honour of a Publick Triumph, and the
particular Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſſes of the King, and the whole <hi>Court.</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midſt

Envy, which always endeavours to leſſen the Reputation of the Brave and
Heroick.</p>

Three Years ago in the Conqueſt of that City; nor ſullied thy preſent

Child not worth a Tear. The Women have no par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Tenderneſſes for their

Young, to rowl in Snow, and Bathe themſelves in Ice diſſolv'd to

Heat and Cold, Hunger, Thirſt and Labour, that when they come of Age, and can
bear Arms, they may go boldly to the Wars, and bravely throw their Lives away
to ſerve the Publick Good. In this, they ſeem to revive the Wiſdom of the
An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient <hi>Spartans,</hi> who gloried in Nothing ſo much, as in educating
their Youth hardily, and free from the Effeminate Softneſſes of other
Nations. They eſteem'd Infancy and Youth, the Spring time of good Manners,
when Vertue is in the Bloſſom: If that be nip'd or blaſted, the Fruit
muſt prove abor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive and unprofitable. Therefore they took Care, to

               <p>But, thou wilt ſay, I take large Leaps, from the
<hi>North</hi> of <hi>Europe,</hi> to one of the moſt <hi>Sou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern</hi>
Tracts in <hi>Aſia.</hi> I was diſcourſing of the <hi>Moſcovites,</hi>
and the Aſſiſtance they afforded the <hi>Coſſacks</hi> in recovering
<hi>Aſac.</hi> I paſſed from thence to the Manner of their Education.
Permit me now, to divert thee with Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing peculiar and uncommon, in the
Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of the <hi>Ruſſian</hi> Women. I am ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with a Gentleman
in this City, who <pb n="194" facs="tcp:99492:112"/>has travelled through all that Part of
<hi>Europe,</hi> and reſided ſome Years at <hi>Moſco.</hi> He ſays, The
<hi>Ruſſian</hi> Wives think themſelves not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved by their Husbands,
unleſs they beat them every Day. They take his Correction, as a Mark of his
Favour and Eſteem. If theſe ſilly Females are angry or peeviſh, he has
no other way to court 'em into a better Humour, but by Stripes. This is the
only convincing Argument of his Sovereignty over them, the Demonſtration of
his Manhood, the Charm which faſtens both their Love and Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience.</p>
               <p>He highly applauds the abſolute Reſigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which this
People ſhew to their <hi>Great Duke;</hi> in that they pretend not to
Poſſeſs their Eſtates and Lives, but through his Favour, and during his
Pleaſure. He ſays, the <hi>Succeſſion</hi> of the <hi>Czars,</hi> or
<hi>Great Dukes</hi> of <hi>Ruſſia,</hi> was in former Times determin'd
after this Manner. A great Stone was plac'd in a large Field be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the
City of <hi>Moſco.</hi> When any <hi>Czar</hi> died, His Sons or the next of
Kin, were conducted into this Field, and placed all at an equal Diſtance from
the Stone: Then, at a certain Signal given, they all ran together toward it;
and, he that firſt reach'd it, ſo as to ſtand on the Top of it, was
eſtabliſh'd in the <hi>Throne.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Reverence which theſe People pay to their <hi>Prince,</hi>
may in Part be aſcribed to his ſeldom appearing in Perſon to them, and
then ſurrounded with his <hi>Boyars</hi> or <hi>Nobles,</hi> in the moſt
Magnificent Equipage, that can <pb n="195" facs="tcp:99492:112"/>be ſuppoſed proper, to
ſtrike a Terror and Awe into his Subjects, and cauſe them to Honour him, as
little leſs than a <hi>God.</hi> The Eyes of the Vulgar, are dazl'd with ſo
many Splendors, of Silver, Gold, and Jewels; And, when the <hi>Great Duke</hi>
makes his ſolemn Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance or Cavalcade, they are almoſt ready to think,
That Heaven has deſcended to Earth, to do them the Honour of a Viſit.
Theſe are the Arts of <hi>Ruſſian</hi> Policy, by which ſuch an
Infinite Number of People are charm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, into an Obedience to the
<hi>Sovereign.</hi> Doubtleſs, the <hi>Majeſty</hi> of a <hi>King,</hi>
receives no ſmall Luſtre from External Ornaments; the Multitude being
captivated, with whatſoever is Gay and Glittering. Yet, our Glorious
<hi>Sultans,</hi> ſcorn to borrow Advantage from, or owe their Grandeur to
any Thing, but their Exalted Blood, and ſublime, innate Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues.</p>
               <p>But, every Nation have their peculiar Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms, and diſtinct
Reaſons of State. The Conſtitution of all Governments is not alike: The

               <p>I Am juſt now return'd to my Chamber, from the <hi>Palace</hi>

the Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnatures of a profound Sorrow, which ſeems to have diffuſed it
ſelf over their whole Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies; for, both the <hi>Court</hi> and <hi>City</hi>
have put on <hi>Mourning,</hi> for the Death of <hi>Henry Bour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bon,</hi> late
<hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Conde.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He was not full Sixty Years of Age, when he left this Viſible
World, to be new-born in a Region utterly unknown to Mortals. The
<hi>French,</hi> not without Reaſon, lament the Loſs of a Man, who, to
ſpeak the Leaſt of him, buoy'd up the Domeſtick Intereſt of this
Kingdom, which ſeemed otherwiſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining to totter. He was the Balance,
which pois'd the different Paſſions of the <hi>Court</hi> and
<hi>City;</hi> by his Prudence and Juſtice, calming both into a peaceable
Mediocrity.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="197" facs="tcp:99492:113"/>He was born ſome <hi>Moons</hi> after
his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Death, whom the moſt execrable Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of Murdering, would not
ſuffer to Spin out thoſe Years, which <hi>Nature</hi> would have indulg'd
him; being ſnatch'd away by Poiſon.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Henry</hi> IV. ſo long as he remain'd without Iſſue,
fix'd his Eyes on this Poſthumous Young <hi>Prince,</hi> and gave him an
Education ſuitable to one, whom <hi>Fate</hi> had deſigned to be the Heir
of the <hi>Crown.</hi> Yet afterwards, Jealouſie cool'd his Affection, when
the <hi>Prince</hi> had married <hi>Charleotte,</hi> the <hi>Duke</hi> of
<hi>Montmoren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy</hi>'s Daughter, whom <hi>Henry</hi> IV. loved to a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of
Paſſion.</p>
               <p>It is dangerous to have a Sovereign Prince, ones Rival in Love.
That Match had well-nigh ruined the Young <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Conde.</hi> He
was forced to fly into <hi>Holland</hi> with his <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs,</hi> and make
that <hi>Province</hi> the Sanctuary of her Honour. From thence he travelled
through <hi>Germany,</hi> and return'd not to <hi>France,</hi> till after the
Murder of <hi>Henry</hi> IV.</p>
               <p>During the Minority of <hi>Lewis</hi> XIII. he Headed the
Factions, affecting to become Popular. Were it not for this Ambition, his Life
had been without Blemiſh, and he might have blown out <hi>Diogenes</hi> his
<hi>Mid-day-Candle.</hi> But, no Man is free from Fault. All the Difference
between the Vertuous and Vicious, conſiſts in this, That one commits fewer
Crimes than the other, and thoſe not by In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention or Habit, but through the
Inſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Proclivity of <hi>Nature.</hi> Every Man has 
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:99492:114"/>his <hi>Genial</hi> Vices, his <hi>Conſtitutional</hi>
Errors; and, though he may appear a <hi>Saint</hi> in all Things elſe, yet in
theſe he will ſtill be a <hi>Sinner.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He ſuffered Five Years Impriſonment in the
<hi>Baſtile,</hi> which is a Place put to the ſame Uſe, as the
<hi>Caſtle</hi> of the <hi>Seven Towers</hi> in <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople.</hi>
The <hi>Princeſs</hi> his Wiſe, was his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion all the Time, and
ſhared in his Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes, as well as his Proſperity.</p>
               <p>During that tedious Confinement, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came Father of a
Daughter, who was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Married to the <hi>Duke</hi> of
<hi>Longueville.</hi> And, when he was ſet at Liberty, he begot the
<hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Enguien,</hi> now <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Conde,</hi> and
the <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Conti.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>French</hi> ſpeak well of the Departed
<hi>Prince.</hi> He was of a lively Spirit, chearful and affable in
Converſation, mixing daily Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creations with his ſeverer Buſineſs,
regularly obſerving Order in all his Affairs. Yet, they ſay, he was
Covetous, having heaped up great Treaſures, by a Parſimony which none of
that <hi>Blood</hi> had ever before practiſed.</p>
               <p>On his Death-bed, he recommended Two Things to the Practice of
his Son, the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Enguien; Never to revenge a Private
In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury;</hi> And, <hi>freely to hazard his Life, for the Publick
Good.</hi>

               <p>THE <hi>Poſts</hi> from <hi>Catalonia</hi> came in laſt
Night, laden with ill News from the Army, which has been forced to decamp from
before <hi>Lerida,</hi> leaving the greateſt Part of their Artillery to the

<hi>Deſtiny.</hi> All his Former Merito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Actions, ſeem now to be
cancell'd, by this one Diſgrace, though it was unavoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able: So peeviſh are
<hi>Princes,</hi> when their Expectations are croſs'd. Some ſuſpect him
guilty of private Correſpondence; Others tax him with Cowardiſe. All this
is, during the Heat of their Reſentments: The ſame Perſons, it may be,
will change their Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, when they conſider, that he had lain before it
Seven <hi>Moons,</hi> even till the Trenches of his Camp were filled with Snow,
and that his Soldiers died of Famine or Cold: For, the <pb n="200" facs="tcp:99492:115"/>
                  <hi>Winter</hi> began to be inſupportable, and the Country was
barren of all Things neceſſary to ſuſtain ſuch an Army. I cannot

               <p>They ſay, there is a Fountain in this <hi>Iſland,</hi>
whoſe Waters flow at the <hi>Sun-riſing;</hi> but, in the <hi>Evening,</hi>

               <p>IT appears to me, by evident Symptoms, that there is ſome deep
Deſign afoot in this <hi>Court.</hi> The <hi>Grandees</hi> aſſemble
often, and ſit late. Extraordinary <hi>Couriers</hi> are ſent out, and come
in, at all Hours of the Night. Strange Reports are induſtriouſly ſpread
a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the City. Trading is at a Stand, the Banquiers reſerv'd, and little
Money ſtirring; which makes the Populace murmur. They complain of the Times,
as is uſual in Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Diſcontents: The <hi>Old</hi> diſcourage and
incenſe the <hi>Young,</hi> by making Compariſons of this Age and Reign,
with the Happy Days of <hi>Henry the Great.</hi> They fill their Ears, with
Golden Stories of former Times; and, inſpiring into them a Love of the
Paſt, they equally introduce a Hatred of the Preſent Government. Theſe
are the Common Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifices of Faction. And, though none appears 
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:99492:116"/>yet under any diſtinct Name or Title, yet 'tis eaſie
to Prognoſticare, from theſe Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ludes, That are long the Maſque will be
taken off, and Sedition will ſhew her ſelf bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fac'd.</p>
               <p>Tother Day, a Follow run Crying through the Streets, <hi>God
ſave the</hi> King, <hi>but the Devil take the</hi> Italian. He was followed
by a few, and thoſe of the moſt Contemptible. Yet, no Officer or
Magiſtrate in this City, would cauſe him to be apprehended, or attempt to
ſuppreſs the Mutiny he was raiſing. The Citizens ſmil'd at his
Boldneſs, and Money was brought him from unknown Hands: The Women bleſs'd
Him as a <hi>Prophet,</hi> and the Virgins fell down before the <hi>Altars</hi>
on his Behalf: The <hi>Temples</hi> were crowded with Votaries, or rather with
the Fautors of this new Sedition; as if they ſtrove to draw their
<hi>Gods</hi> into the Cabal, and would make <hi>Heaven</hi> it ſelf abert
their Tumults. His Train encreas'd, as he meaſured the Streets; till at
length he was ſeiz'd by the <hi>Royal</hi> Guards, the Rabble diſperſed,
and all Things reſtored to Quiet. That Night, a Double <hi>Watch</hi> was
kept throughout the City; the Fellow was ſtrictly examin'd, and put to the
<hi>Rack;</hi> yet no Confeſſion could be extorted from him, ſave,
<hi>That the Publick Good in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd him to take this Courſe; That the Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny
and Oppreſſion which</hi> Cardinal Maza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rini <hi>exerciſed, were
Inſupportable; and, That he was ready to ſacrifice his Life for the
Wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare of his Country.</hi> He is condemn'd to the <pb n="203" facs="tcp:99492:116"/>Gallies during his Life. And, great Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours are uſed, to find
out the Authors of this Novelty. For, he is look'd on but as an Inſtrument,
ſet at Work by ſome Male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contents of higher Quality, and the Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runner of
ſome more formidable Inſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
               <p>Proclamations are iſſued out, to forbid all Diſcourſe of
<hi>State</hi>-Matters; but, the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſpare not, to whiſper their
Sentiments.</p>
               <p>The Young King is taken ill, which aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments the Publick
Jealouſie: Men ſhake their Heads, and look dejected, as they walk along the
Streets. Some menace Revenge with their furrowed Brows; others ſpeak openly,
<hi>That the Kingdom is ſold to Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers.</hi> A General Conſternation
and Diſorder has ſeiz'd all, while their Fears prompt 'em daily to expect a
Change. To obviate the Miſchiefs which theſe Popular Paſſions threaten,
Soldiers are drawn from divers Parts of the Country by <hi>Mazarini</hi>'s
Order, and by inſenſible Companies quarter'd up and down <hi>Paris.</hi>
Between theſe and the Citizens, there happen divers Quarrels, fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
Murders are committed; while the Night, which covers all Things with
Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, ſerves to ſhroud their mutual Outrages, and private Revenges.
Thus, the Publick Calamities are cheriſh'd: What will be the Iſſue, Time
will evince.</p>
               <p>In the mean while, the Affairs of <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many</hi> and
<hi>Suedeland,</hi> ſeem to be in a fair Way of Compoſure. Divers
<hi>Treaties</hi> are on Foot, <pb n="204" facs="tcp:99492:117"/>in Order to a General
Peace in <hi>Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</hi> The <hi>Embaſſadors</hi> and
<hi>Deputies</hi> of the ſeveral Conteſting <hi>Crowns,</hi> have frequent
Conferences. But, each Party inſiſts ſo ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemently on Circumſtantials,
that Nothing but fruitleſs Demurs conclude their Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings. <hi>France</hi>

ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Rules of Profit. They ſtand on no <hi>Punctilio's,</hi> but

               <head>LETTER XXI. To <hi>Peſtelihali,</hi> his Brother.</head>
               <p>I Thought my ſelf forgotten by the <hi>Son</hi> of my
<hi>Mother,</hi> who has ſuffer'd ſo many <hi>Decads</hi> of <hi>Moons</hi>
to meaſure out the Term of his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind Silence, and of my Melancholy. 'Tis
now Three Years, ſince I heard from thee: But, I will not complain, of a
Fault ſo inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuouſly expiated, though late. Thou haſt made me ample
Amends, in ſending me ſuch an Elaborate and Succinct <hi>Hiſtory</hi> of
thy <hi>Travels:</hi> In reading of which, I know not whether my Pleaſure or
Proſit is greater. Thou haſt ſo interwoven Delightful Adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of thy
own, and pleaſant Paſſages of others, with Curious and Solid
Obſervations, that a Man improves himſelf Inſenſibly; whilſt the
Charming Language and Miſcella<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, ſerve as a Spur, at once to rowze and
fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten his Attention, to Points of moſt uſeful Knowledge.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Chriſtians</hi> are apt to deſpiſe the <hi>True
Believers,</hi> as a Company of Ignorant Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, Unacquainted with the
<hi>World,</hi> Unpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh'd both in their Underſtandings and Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, not
vers'd in the <hi>Liberal Sciences,</hi> nor addicted to the Study of any
Thing, but Riches and Honour, and how to augment the <hi>Muſſulman
Empire.</hi> They conſider not at the ſame Time, that <hi>God</hi> has made
us <hi>Rational</hi> 
                  <pb n="207" facs="tcp:99492:118"/>Creatures, as well as them; has
endued us with the ſame <hi>Natural</hi> Faculties; and, that in all
<hi>Nations,</hi> he has Inſpir'd ſome with a Thirſt of Knowledge,
furniſhing them alſo with the Abilities and Means to attain it. They
conſider not, that if <hi>Printing</hi> be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited among us, 'tis to
ſuppreſs the Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of Unprofitable <hi>Books,</hi> with which
<hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope</hi> too much abounds: And, that in their Stead, we have many
Thouſands of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtrious <hi>Scribes,</hi> whoſe whole Employment is, to
tranſlate the moſt Excellent and Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned <hi>Treatiſes</hi> of the
<hi>Ancients.</hi> And, that conſequently, a ſtudious <hi>Mahometan</hi>
cannot be deſtitute of ſuch <hi>Books,</hi> as may inſtruct him in
<hi>True Philoſophy,</hi> ſound <hi>Morals,</hi> and the <hi>Hiſtory</hi>
of the Moſt Memorable Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions in the World. Aſſuredly, our
<hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bia</hi> may boaſt of her <hi>Avicen's, Meſue's, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verroe's,
Hali's</hi> and <hi>Albumazar's;</hi> and, that ſhe has brought forth many
others, who need not in any Point of <hi>Human</hi> or <hi>Divine
Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,</hi> yield the <hi>Palm</hi> to the moſt Eminent <hi>Doctors,
Philoſophers, Orators</hi> and <hi>Poets</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the
<hi>Chriſtians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Add to this, the equal Benefit ſome of our <hi>Belief</hi>
reap, by Travelling into Foreign Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, which crowns all their Studies
with Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perimental Knowledge and Wiſdom: Rend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring them as familiar, with the
different <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures</hi> of <hi>Men,</hi> and the various
<hi>Conſtitutions</hi> of <hi>Government,</hi> as before they were with
<hi>Books.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This appears evident in thy Letter, which <pb n="208" facs="tcp:99492:119"/>is repleniſhed with ſo many ſolid Remarks and ſage Comments,
on the <hi>Laws</hi> and <hi>Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms</hi> of the <hi>Regions</hi> through
which thou haſt paſs'd, their <hi>Religions, Strength</hi> and
<hi>Riches,</hi> and whatſoever elſe was worthy a <hi>Traveller</hi>'s
No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice; That, were this <hi>Narrative</hi> publiſh'd in
<hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> the <hi>Nazarenes</hi> would forbear to ſpeak ſo
contemptibly of the <hi>True Believers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But, they flatter themſelves with a falſe Notion, That the
<hi>Ottomans</hi> never travel beyond the Limits of their own <hi>Empire,</hi>
ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the <hi>Publick Chiauſes,</hi> who are ſent by the <hi>Grand
Signior.</hi> They are ignorant, that the <hi>Auguſt Port</hi> maintains
<hi>Private Agents</hi> in all <hi>Nations;</hi> and, that there is hardly any
<hi>Prince</hi>'s <hi>Court</hi> in <hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> without a
<hi>Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulman</hi> in it one Time or other. 'Tis true, we appear not in
the <hi>Garb</hi> peculiar to the <hi>Eaſt.</hi> Our <hi>Miſſion,</hi>
requires a <hi>Conformity</hi> to the <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhions</hi> of the
<hi>People</hi> where we Reſide. But, we ſtill retain the Interiour
Veſtment of <hi>Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metan Purity;</hi> being in a double Senſe
<hi>Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed.</hi> Thus we become Maſters of the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians</hi>
Secrets, whilſt they account us Stupid, Ignorant, and Men void of Common
Sence.</p>
               <p>Beſides, had we not this Advantage, in theſe
<hi>Weſtern</hi> Parts; yet, the Univerſal Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge of Travelling and
maintaining free Commerce over all the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> muſt needs afford
great Opportunities of Accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to ſome among the <hi>Caravans</hi>
of ſo many Thouſands, as viſit <hi>Perſia, India, China, Tartary,</hi>
and all Places where the <hi>Faith</hi> of the <hi>Miſſioner</hi> of
<hi>God</hi> is profeſſed.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="209" facs="tcp:99492:119"/>I am extreamly pleaſed with thy
fortunate Eſcapes from <hi>Robbers</hi> on the Road, whoſe Malice rarely
extends farther, than to deprive a Man of thoſe <hi>Outward Goods,</hi>
which, if he be <hi>wiſe,</hi> he will not call <hi>his Own.</hi> Much more
am I delighted, with thy Deliverance from thoſe <hi>Female</hi> Thieves, who
ſteal from Men their Hearts and Reaſon; which laſt, is our Nobleſt, and
onely proper Inheritance. All <hi>Perſia</hi> and the <hi>Indies,</hi> abound
with <hi>Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tezans;</hi> and, he had need of <hi>Oſman</hi>'s Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtity,
who would withſtand ſo many and ſtrong Temptations.</p>
               <p>Thou needeſt not wonder at the Effemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacy of the Preſent
<hi>Mogul,</hi> who ſuffers himſelf and his <hi>State,</hi> to be governed
by <hi>Women.</hi> That Subtle and Aſpiring <hi>Sex,</hi> have always
ſought to undermine or over-reach our <hi>Race.</hi> They keep behind the
<hi>Scenes,</hi> yet act their Parts, in all the <hi>Tragedies</hi> and
<hi>Revolutions</hi> of the <hi>World.</hi> The Father of the preſent
<hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian</hi> King, made an Abſolute Reſignation of his
<hi>Sovereignty</hi> to his Queen, for Four and Twenty Hours. This
<hi>Prince,</hi> by a ſtrange Affectation, called himſelf, <hi>King of the
World.</hi> His Wife was the Daughter of an <hi>Arabian</hi> Captain, who had
ſerved him in the Wars: But, having forfeited his Head by ſome Notorious
<hi>Treaſon,</hi> his Daughter went and threw her ſelf at the
<hi>Mogul</hi>'s Feet to beg his Life. He fell paſſionately in Love with
her, (for, ſhe had not her Equal for Beauty in all the <hi>Eaſt</hi>)
granted her <hi>Petition,</hi> and married her. Afterwards, ſhe got ſuch an
<hi>Empire</hi> over <pb n="210" facs="tcp:99492:120"/>him, that he would do Nothing
without her Advice and Conſent. At her Inſtigation, he made <hi>War</hi> or
<hi>Peace:</hi> And, to pleaſe her Cruel Humour, he put out the Eyes of his
Eldeſt Son. But, not ſatisfied with theſe Diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of his Love, and
reſolving to make her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf Famous by ſome extraordinary Action, ſhe
never ceas'd ſolliciting the King, with all the Arts of Female Policy, till
ſhe had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed on him, to ſurrender up his Authority to her for the
Space of a Day. In which Time (having prepared all Things before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand ready for
her Purpoſe) ſhe cauſed Two Millions of <hi>Roupies</hi> in Silver and
Gold to be coin'd, and ſtamp'd with the <hi>Twelve Signs</hi> of the
<hi>Zodiack;</hi> contrary to the <hi>Fundamental Laws</hi> of the
<hi>Empire,</hi> the <hi>Expreſs Prohibition</hi> of our <hi>Holy
Prophet,</hi> and the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Practice</hi> of the
<hi>Muſſulman's</hi> throughout the <hi>World,</hi> who admit not the
<hi>Repreſentations</hi> of any <hi>Creatures</hi> that have <hi>Life.</hi>
This Relation I had from my <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncle <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſeph,</hi> who reſided in the
<hi>Indian Court</hi> Eleven Years. He added moreover, That during this ſhort
<hi>Female Reign,</hi> ſhe cut off the Heads of Seven <hi>Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dees,</hi> the
moſt zealous for the <hi>Muſſulman Faith</hi> among all the <hi>Indian
Princes,</hi> and eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed as many <hi>Idolaters</hi> in their
<hi>Places:</hi> And, that if her <hi>Orders</hi> had been fully exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted,
ſhe had quite changed the <hi>Government,</hi> Conſecrated the moſt
beautiful <hi>Moſquees</hi> to the <hi>Service</hi> of <hi>Idols,</hi>
Exterminated the <hi>True Faithful,</hi> and Reſtored the <hi>Ancient
Abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations</hi> of the <hi>Infidels.</hi> Which thou wilt not 
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:99492:120"/>think Impracticable, when thou conſidereſt, That the
Number of the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncircumciſed</hi> in the <hi>Indies,</hi> far exceeds
that of the <hi>Muſſulman's;</hi> there being Ten Thouſand of thoſe, to
a Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred of ſuch as profeſs the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity</hi> of the <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Nature.</hi> But however, there was <hi>Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty</hi> found even among thoſe
<hi>Pagans;</hi> and, they would not fuffer a <hi>Blind Zeal</hi> for the
<hi>Worſhip</hi> of their <hi>Gods,</hi> to ſupplant the <hi>Duty</hi> they
ow'd their <hi>King.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Deſcription thou haſt made of <hi>Canda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>har,</hi> and
the Method thou haſt projected to take that <hi>Impregnable City,</hi>
diſcover at once thy Conduct and Diligence, in procuring Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to ſurvey
ſo narrowly, the moſt Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant Place of the <hi>Indies;</hi> and thy
Skill in For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifications, with the Quickneſs of thy Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which has
ſuggeſted to thee, that which all the <hi>Engineers</hi> of <hi>Aſia</hi>
have never ſo much as dreamt of. This is the right Uſe of Travelling, when
a Man returns from Foreign <hi>Nations,</hi> cultivated with Experimental
Knowledge, and ſtock'd with Improvements, that may render him ſerviceable
to his Country.</p>
               <p>Thou condemneſt the Injuſtice and Ava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice of the <hi>Indian
Mogul's;</hi> who, as ſoon as any of the <hi>Omrahs,</hi> or <hi>Great
Men</hi> die, cauſe all his Eſtate and Goods to be ſeiz'd, to their own
proper Uſe. Whereby it comes to paſs, that the Widow and Children of the
Deceaſed, are reduced to the loweſt Condition of Poverty, being many Times
forced to beg for a Subſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtence. 'Tis true, this is an Oppreſſion not
to be juſtified, eſpecially in thoſe who profeſs <pb n="212" facs="tcp:99492:121"/>to Believe in <hi>One God, Creator</hi> of <hi>All Things,</hi> the
<hi>Incorrupt Judge</hi> of the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſe.</hi> But, what thinkeſt
thou then of our <hi>Sultans,</hi> who not having Patience to wait, till a
<hi>Natural</hi> Death ſhall make them <hi>Heirs</hi> to the <hi>Wealth</hi>
of a <hi>Baſſa,</hi> generally ſecure their <hi>Title,</hi> and haſten
their Poſſeſſion by a <hi>Bow-ſtring?</hi> Theſe are <hi>Royal</hi>
Violences: Though the Reſigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Subjects,</hi> muſt not tax them
with any Crime, who are Accountable to none but <hi>God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It was, however, a notable Piece of Rail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery, with which the
Widow of a Rich <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant,</hi> reproved this Unreaſonable Cuſtom in
the preſent <hi>Mogul.</hi> Her Husband was an <hi>Idolater,</hi> who had
heaped together an Infinite Treaſure by Trading and Uſury; and, when he
died, left her Worth Two Hundred Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand <hi>Roupies.</hi> Her Son, ſome
Years after coming of Age, demanded of her a Stock to ſet up with as a
<hi>Merchant.</hi> Which ſhe, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther out of Avarice, or for other Ends,
refuſed him; furniſhing him onely with ſuch ſmall Sums, as ſerved to
nouriſh his Diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, and tempt him to a lewd careleſs Life. But at
length, not being able to prevail on his Mother, to part with ſo much as
would anſwer his Expectations, he complained to the <hi>Mogul,</hi>
diſcloſing alſo what Eſtate his Father had left. The <hi>Mogul</hi>
being inform'd of ſo much Riches, ſent for the Young Man's Mother, and
commanded her, to ſend him Half her Mony; ordering, that the other Half,
ſhould be divided between her Self and her Son. The Widow not being at all
ſurprized, <pb n="213" facs="tcp:99492:121"/>or caſt down at this unjuſt Propoſal,
made the <hi>Mogul</hi> this ſhort Reply: <hi>O King, may the Gods make thee
Happy. My Son has ſome Reaſon to require his Share of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's
Eſtate, having his Blood running in his Veins; but, I deſire to know, what
Relation Thou art to my Husband or Me, that Thou claimeſt a Share in his
Inheritance.</hi> The <hi>Prince</hi> abaſh'd at ſo ſmart and bold an
Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs, commanded her to give Half her Eſtate to her Son, and ſo
diſmiſſed her.</p>
               <p>I have heard ſome of our <hi>Chiauſes</hi> praiſe the
<hi>Magniſicence</hi> of the <hi>Mogul's Court,</hi> the Infinite Number of
his Attendants: But, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all, they extol the Inimitable Grandeur of his
<hi>Throne,</hi> which is adorn'd with ſo many Topazes, Rubies, Emeraulds,
Pearls and Diamonds, as amount to Thirty Millions of <hi>Roupies.</hi> But,
were it not much better, if in ſtead of all this Needleſs Glory, he could
boaſt, That his <hi>Empire</hi> is founded in the Hearts of his
<hi>Subjects?</hi> He does not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, That ſuch prodigious Heaps of
envied Treaſure, are but ſo many Glittering <hi>Snares,</hi> Golden
<hi>Manacles,</hi> which ſerve for no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Uſe, but to chain him up from
that Freedom, and thoſe more Innocent De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights, that the Meaneſt of his
Subjects en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy.</p>
               <p>Thou haſt, I perceive, diſcourſed with the <hi>Indian
Bramins:</hi> Doſt not thou diſcover, even in theſe <hi>Idolaters,</hi> a
Contempt of Riches? What mean Thoughts have they, of the Splen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor and Gayeties
of the <hi>Court?</hi> What a low <pb n="214" facs="tcp:99492:122"/>Eſteem, of the Long
and Proud <hi>Series</hi> of <hi>Titles,</hi> with which the <hi>Moguls</hi>
endeavour to exalt themſelves? Whilſt they are call'd, the <hi>Lights of
the World,</hi> and <hi>Companions of the Sun;</hi> theſe poor
<hi>Philoſophers</hi> know, That in a Little Time, they ſhall be laid in
<hi>Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> and have no better <hi>Society</hi> than that of
<hi>Worms.</hi> What ſignifies their <hi>Pedigree;</hi> or, that the
preſent <hi>Mogul,</hi> is but the <hi>Tenth Deſcendent</hi> from the
<hi>Mighty Temurlen,</hi> who made all <hi>Aſia</hi> tremble, if he has
loſt the <hi>Vertue</hi> of his <hi>Glorious Anceſtor?</hi> 'Tis that
alone, makes all Men <hi>truly Noble.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thou telleſt me, That the <hi>Empire</hi> of the
<hi>Mogul,</hi> affords him more <hi>Revenues,</hi> than the <hi>Dominions</hi>
of any Two the moſt Potent <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchs</hi> on Earth. I have heard as much
from Others; which convinces me, That thou haſt inform'd thy ſelf rightly
of the <hi>Preſent State</hi> of the <hi>Indies.</hi> But doſt thou
therefore eſteem this <hi>Monarch</hi> the Richer? Conſider the vaſt
Extent of his <hi>Dominions,</hi> which are ſaid to contain more than Six
Hundred Leagues in Length, and thou wilt find, that to maintain ſo great a
Tract of Ground, both againſt his <hi>Foreign</hi> and <hi>Dome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick</hi>
Enemies, he is oblig'd to keep in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Pay, ſome Millions of his
Subjects and Strangers: For, he is in the Midſt of Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, even amongſt
his own <hi>Subjects.</hi> There are above an Hundred <hi>Sovereigns</hi> in
his <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire,</hi> who perpetually by Turns moleſt his
<hi>Government,</hi> refuſing to pay <hi>Tribute,</hi> and raiſing Armies
againſt him: Whereby it <pb n="215" facs="tcp:99492:122"/>comes to paſs, That he is at
an Infinite Expence to defend himſelf, and carry on thoſe End<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Wars.
Thou thy ſelf having obſerv'd, That once in Two <hi>Moons,</hi> there is an
Indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſible Neceſſity of paying theſe prodigious Armies: Not a
Soldier throughout his <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire,</hi> having any Thing to live on, ſave
the Wages he receives of the King.</p>
               <p>Conſider alſo, that this <hi>Monarch,</hi> always keeps
ſome Thouſands of the fineſt Horſes in the World, near his Perſon,
ſuch as coſt him Thouſands of <hi>Roupies</hi> apiece: Beſides a
Thouſand Elephants, with an Incredible Number of Mules, Camels, and other
Beaſts of Burden, to carry his Wives, his Goods and Proviſions when he
takes the Field: That whole Cities, even as Large as
<hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople,</hi> are obliged to follow the Kings Camp for
Subſiſtence, their Livelihood alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether depending on the Army. Add to
this, the Immenſe Charges of his <hi>Seraglio,</hi> his Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles and
Sea-Port Towns, with all the other Neceſſary Expences of the
<hi>State;</hi> and thou wilt conclude, That when this <hi>Potentate</hi> comes
to caſt up his Accompts, he will find himſelf a Poor Man.</p>
               <p>But, I ſhall cloy thee with a Rehearſal of ſuch Things, as
thou canſt not be a Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to.</p>
               <p>Only tell me, Whether one of the <hi>Raias,</hi> or
<hi>Princes</hi> ſubject to the <hi>Mogul,</hi> be the real
<hi>Deſcendent</hi> of <hi>Porus,</hi> the Ancient King of <hi>India,</hi> in
the time of <hi>Alexander the Great?</hi> I have been told by ſeveral
<hi>Travellers,</hi> that <pb n="216" facs="tcp:99492:123"/>there is ſuch an One, that
his Name is <hi>Rana,</hi> and that an Hundred of the <hi>Idolatrous
Princes,</hi> pay Homage to him, as to their <hi>Natural So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thou confirmeſt the Truth, of what has been ſo often
reported in theſe Parts, That the <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Java</hi> has Six
Fingers on each Hand, and as many Toes on his Feet.</p>
               <p>But, that ſeems very ſtrange, which thou relateſt, of a
certain <hi>Language</hi> among the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians,</hi> which is not Vulgarly
ſpoken; but, that all their <hi>Books</hi> of <hi>Theology,</hi> the
<hi>Pandects</hi> of their <hi>Laws,</hi> the <hi>Records</hi> of their
<hi>Nation,</hi> and the <hi>Treatiſes</hi> of <hi>Humane Arts</hi> and
<hi>Sciences</hi> are written in it. And, that this <hi>Language,</hi> is
taught in their <hi>Schools, Colleges</hi> and <hi>Aca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demies,</hi> even as
<hi>Latin</hi> is among the <hi>Chriſtians.</hi> I cannot enough admire at
this: For, where and when was this <hi>Language</hi> ſpoken? How came it to
be diſus'd? There ſeems to be a Myſtery in it, that none of their
<hi>Brachmans</hi> can give any other Account of this, ſave, That it is the
<hi>Language,</hi> wherein <hi>God</hi> gave to the <hi>Firſt Creature</hi>
he made, the <hi>Four Books</hi> of the <hi>Law;</hi> which, according to their
<hi>Chronology,</hi> was above Thirty Millions of Years ago. I tell thee, my
Dear Brother, this News has ſtarted ſome odd Notions in my Mind: For, when
I conſider, that this <hi>Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage,</hi> as thou ſayeſt, has nothing in
it Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon with the <hi>Indian</hi> that is now ſpoken, nor with any other
<hi>Language</hi> of <hi>Aſia,</hi> or of the World; and yet, that it is a
Copious and Regular <hi>Language,</hi> learn'd by <hi>Grammar,</hi> 
                  <pb n="217" facs="tcp:99492:123"/>like the other <hi>Maternal Languages;</hi> and, that in
this <hi>Obſolete Language, Books</hi> are written, wherein it is
aſſerted, That the <hi>World</hi> is ſo many Millions of Years old; I
could almoſt turn <hi>Pythagorean,</hi> and believe the <hi>World</hi> to be
within a <hi>Minute</hi> of <hi>Eternal.</hi> And, where would be the
Abſurdity? Since <hi>God</hi> had equally the ſame Infinite Power, Wiſdom

               <p>SEveral <hi>Diſpatches</hi> have been lately ſent be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
this <hi>Court</hi> and that of <hi>Sucdeland;</hi> containing rather Matter of
Compliment, than any Thing of Great Importance. Queen <hi>Chriſtina</hi> has
been very Ill, which has occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion'd Letters of Condoleance from the
<hi>Queen-Regent</hi> of <hi>France.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thoſe which come from that Part ſay, That <hi>General
Torſtenſon</hi> is made a <hi>Count,</hi> and the <hi>Dignity</hi> entail'd
to his <hi>Poſterity,</hi> in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compenſe of his Eminent Services to the
<hi>Suediſh Crown.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe Letters add, That there have paſs'd ſome high Words,
between <hi>Monſieur Chanut,</hi> and the <hi>Sucdiſh Secretary</hi> of
<hi>State.</hi> And, that the latter, in going out of the Chamber where they
diſcourſed, laid his Hand upon his Sword, with theſe Words;
<hi>Monſieur Chanut, Were is not for the Fence which the</hi> Law <hi>of</hi>
Nations <hi>has raiſed about your Perſon, I would anſwer you in another
Language.</hi> To which <hi>Monſieur Chanut</hi> replied, <hi>That he wore a
Sword to defend himſelf and his Private Honour, as well as any</hi> Suede
<hi>in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Occaſion of this Quarrel was, the great Reſort of
<hi>Roman Catholick</hi> Strangers to <hi>Monſieur Chanut</hi>'s Chappel,
which gave diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt <pb n="219" facs="tcp:99492:124"/>to the <hi>Suedes,</hi> who allow
not the <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe</hi> of the <hi>Roman Religion</hi> within their
Territories. They caſtrate all the <hi>Prieſts</hi> of that
<hi>Communion,</hi> whom they find; and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute the <hi>Laity</hi> with
rigorous Penalties. But, <hi>Monſieur Chanut</hi> pleaded the <hi>Law</hi> of
<hi>Nations:</hi> And, when the <hi>Secretary</hi> told him, That the
<hi>Queen</hi> permitted him and his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily the Liberty of their
<hi>Religion,</hi> but deſired him not to admit any other Perſons of what
<hi>Nations</hi> ſoever; This <hi>Miniſter</hi> replied, <hi>That he could
not receive as a Favour or Permiſſion from her</hi> Majeſty, <hi>the
Liberty of</hi> Exerciſing <hi>his</hi> Religion; <hi>ſince, he held it
only of his</hi> Maſter, <hi>the King of</hi> France, <hi>who had ſent him
thither, and, that he would not ſhut the Door of his</hi> Chappel,
<hi>againſt any that would come in: That their</hi> Law, <hi>which according
to their own Calcule, was made above Two Thouſand Years after the Foundation
of their</hi> Eſtate, <hi>could not abrogate the</hi> Law <hi>of</hi>
Nations, <hi>which is</hi> Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal: <hi>That this</hi> Perpetual Law, <hi>gave
particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Privileges to certain Perſons, and eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to the</hi>
Miniſters <hi>of Foreign</hi> Princes: <hi>That their</hi> New Law,
<hi>ſuch as it was, being only made to maintain the</hi> Publick Worſhip,
<hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected not what was done in the</hi> Houſe <hi>of a Foreign</hi>
Miniſter, <hi>by a Special Privilege; it being of no Conſequence to
the</hi> State, <hi>whether ſuch Foreigners ſerved</hi> God <hi>or not, or
whether they worſhipped Him in a Right or Wrong Way: That no</hi> Suede
<hi>came to his</hi> Chappel, <hi>but only ſome</hi> French <hi>who were
Sojourners in the Land: That they did not uſe the</hi> Suediſh 
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:99492:125"/>Ambaſſadors <hi>ſo in</hi> France, <hi>who admitted
whom they pleaſed into their</hi> Chappels. <hi>That the Houſe where he now
dwelt, was the Houſe of the King of</hi> France, <hi>and that therefore, he
could not by Conſequence refuſe any</hi> Catholicks <hi>an Entrance into
it, eſpecially ſuch as were born Subjects of his</hi> Maſter: <hi>And, in
Fine, That it was very Rude, to oblige him to be the Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutioner of this
ſevere Law, in requiring him to ſhut his Doors upon his Countrymen,
a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the</hi> Common Laws <hi>of</hi> Hoſpitality, <hi>the</hi> Honour
<hi>of a</hi> Publick Miniſter, <hi>and the</hi> Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure <hi>of the</hi>
King <hi>his</hi> Sovereign.</p>
               <p>To this the <hi>Secretary</hi> made ſomething too tart a
Reply. Whereupon, Words increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing between them, and the <hi>French
Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſador</hi> being reſolute to aſſert his Privilege, the
<hi>Secretary</hi> broke out into a Paſſion, as I have before mention'd;
laying his Hand upon his Sword, as he was leaving the Room.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Suedes,</hi> are Naturally a rugged, ſurly People, as
are all the <hi>Northern Europeans.</hi> They are Strangers to Civility, and
the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile Addreſs of the <hi>French.</hi> Yet, the <hi>Queen,</hi> when
ſhe heard of this Paſſage, was angry with her <hi>Miniſter,</hi> and
excuſed his Rudeneſs to <hi>Monſieur Chanut;</hi> telling him, <hi>That
the</hi> Secretary <hi>was a</hi> Faithful Servant, <hi>but had been educated
among the</hi> Bears <hi>of the</hi> Foreſt.</p>
               <p>This puts me in Mind of a <hi>Story,</hi> which the
<hi>French</hi> tell of another <hi>Ambaſſador,</hi> whom <hi>Lewis</hi>
XIII. ſent to the <hi>Court</hi> of <hi>Spain.</hi> The <hi>Spaniards</hi>
are of a haughty Temper, expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <pb n="221" facs="tcp:99492:125"/>more than ordinary
Submiſſions, from thoſe who approach the King's Preſence. This
<hi>Ambaſſador,</hi> on the ſame Ground, was requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to do ſome
Homage, which would not conſiſt with the Inſtructions of his
<hi>Maſter;</hi> and therefore, he refuſed to comply. The King of
<hi>Spain,</hi> thinking to put him out of Countenance, ſaid aloud, <hi>What!
has the King of</hi> France, <hi>no other Men in his</hi> Court, <hi>that he
ſends to me ſuch a Fool as this?</hi> To which the <hi>Ambaſſador</hi>
replied, <hi>My</hi> Maſter <hi>has many Wiſer Men than my ſelf about
him; but, to ſuch a</hi> King, <hi>ſuch an</hi> Ambaſſador.</p>
               <p>Thou wilt not perhaps approve ſuch Rail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery as this to
<hi>Crown'd</hi> Heads, who ought to be treated with Reverence and Gravity.
Yet, I believe, thou wilt condemn the Cruelty of a <hi>Duke</hi> of
<hi>Moſcovy,</hi> who cauſe the Hat of a <hi>French Ambaſſador</hi> to
be nailed to his Head, for ſitting covered before him. This is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to
the <hi>Genius</hi> of the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> who abhor to ſee a Man
bareheaded.</p>
               <p>But, every <hi>Nation</hi> has its <hi>Mode:</hi> And I,
according to the Faſhion of my Country, kiſs the Border of thy Veſt, in
Token of my Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion and Reſpect.</p>

               <p>THE <hi>Criticks,</hi> who ſpend their Time, and manifeſt
their Wit, in deſcanting on the <hi>Court</hi> and the <hi>Grandees,</hi>
find perpetual Matter of Diſcourſe concerning <hi>Cardinal Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarini.</hi>
His daily Actions, furniſh them with New Themes; and ſometimes, they
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearſe the Old. They compare him with his Predeceſſor
<hi>Richlieu,</hi> and with <hi>Cardinal Xi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menes,</hi> a <hi>Spaniſh
Miniſter.</hi> They term theſe Three, the <hi>Trinity</hi> of
<hi>Chriſtian Stateſmen;</hi> Thus diſtinguiſhing their
<hi>Perſonal</hi> Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cters: <hi>Richlieu,</hi> they ſay, was Crafty,
Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous, and Revengeful; <hi>Ximenes</hi> was Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litick, Severe, and Valiant;
<hi>Mazarini</hi> is Wiſe, Merciful and Liberal.</p>
               <p>The Firſt made good his Character, they ſay, in heaping up
ſuch Prodigious Treaſures; in raiſing all thoſe of his <hi>Family</hi>
or Depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, to the Higheſt Honours; in occaſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Voluntary
Baniſhment of the <hi>Queen-Mother;</hi> in ruining whomſoever he

Secrets, That the King, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever diſguſted and averſe from him, yet cou'd
neither ſit ſafe on his <hi>Throne</hi> without him when <hi>Living,</hi>
nor venture the Management <pb n="223" facs="tcp:99492:126"/>of the <hi>Publick</hi> to any
but his Creatures when <hi>Dead.</hi> Thus ſpeak they of that Great
<hi>Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As to <hi>Cardinal Ximenes,</hi> they ſay he diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd the
Qualities which they aſcribe to him, in the Method he took to raiſe
himſelf to that envied Greatneſs; which was, by ſeeming to ſhun the
Honours at which he ſecretly aim'd. For, being a <hi>Devoted Derviſe,</hi>
or <hi>Religious Frier,</hi> he appeared to be the moſt Mortify'd Man of the
whole <hi>Order:</hi> Which being taken Notice of, he was made
<hi>Provincial;</hi> from which <hi>Dignity,</hi> he made but one Step more to
the <hi>Purple:</hi> And, growing Eminent for his Abilities, he was made the
<hi>Firſt Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter</hi> in the <hi>Court</hi> of <hi>Spain.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He levy'd Sixteen Thouſand Men at his own Coſt, invaded
<hi>Barbary,</hi> ſtorm'd their ſtrongeſt Cities, and reduc'd the whole
King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>Tripoli</hi> and <hi>Algiers</hi> to his <hi>Maſter</hi>'s
Obedience.</p>
               <p>Whilſt he was at the Head of his Army, one Day there happen'd
a Mutiny among his Soldiers. A certain Fellow, running up and down between the
Ranks, and exciting them to chuſe a New <hi>General,</hi> ſaying, <hi>It
was a Shame to ſerve a poor-ſpirited Friar:</hi> The <hi>Cardinal</hi>
perceiving this, ſtepp'd to the Fellow, and, with one Blow, ſever'd his
Head from his Body. This ſtruck ſuch a Terror into all, that from that
Time, there was not the leaſt Tumult or Diſorder in his Army.</p>
               <p>They ſay, he was in the End poyſon'd by eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a
<hi>Fiſh,</hi> of which a Friend of his receiv'd <pb n="224" facs="tcp:99492:127"/>Intimation on the Road, as he was riding to the Place where the
<hi>Cardinal</hi> was at Dinner. But, he came too late, to prevent the Effects
of the Poyſon: For, though the <hi>Cardinal</hi> was but juſt riſen from
the Table, yet he began to void Blood by his Ears, and the Extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of his
Fingers; and, in a few Days, drew his laſt Breath. He was Tall, and well
Limb'd; His Two Foreteeth of the Upper Jaw, grew ſo far out of his Mouth,
that he was called, <hi>The Eccleſiaſtick Elephant.</hi> The Sutures of his
Skull, were ſo cloſely indented, that there was no more Room for
Tranſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the Groſſer Vapours, than through the moſt Solid Part
of the Bone. On this Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, he was ever troubled with the Head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ach; contrary
to <hi>Cardinal Richlieu,</hi> who ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver felt any Pain in that Part, becauſe
he had two little Holes in his Crown, through which the Fumes exhal'd.</p>
               <p>Theſe are the Remarks, which are made on <hi>Cardinal
Ximenes.</hi> As to <hi>Mazarini,</hi> they ſay he ſurpaſſes both
theſe <hi>Miniſters,</hi> in the exquiſite Moderation of his Temper: And,
comes ſhort of neither, in the Contrivance or Succeſs of his Affairs; being
ſolid in his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, ſecret and ſwift in their Execution. He had
this alſo peculiar in his Conduct, That none are more ſure of his Favour,
than thoſe who have done him Injuries. He is Magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fick in his Expences;
building <hi>Palaces,</hi> that may vye with the moſt Celebrated Structures
of the Ancient <hi>Romans:</hi> A curious Collector of Choice Paintings, and
Sculptures; furniſhing <pb n="225" facs="tcp:99492:127"/>his Houſes, with Utenſils of
Cedar, Ebony' Silver, Gold and other Ornaments befitting the <hi>Palace</hi> of
a King: Liberal beyond the Expectation of his Friends and Servants; yet, not to
Profuſeneſs. He has a wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Sagacity in diſcovering Cheats and
Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtors; and, no leſs Dexterity, in diſcerning Men of Merit, though
never ſo much obſcur'd by Misfortune.</p>
               <p>Not long ago, he catch'd a Gentleman in a Crime, which expos'd
him to the Laughter and Contempt of the whole <hi>Court,</hi> but not to the
<hi>Cardinal</hi>'s Hatred. He had been recommen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to this
<hi>Miniſter,</hi> by a <hi>Lady</hi> of the <hi>Court,</hi> for whom he had
a great Eſteem. On which Account, he had free Acceſs to the
<hi>Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal</hi>'s Preſence, and would always mix with his
<hi>Retinue.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But, his Curious <hi>Patron,</hi> had obſerv'd ſomething in
his Carriage, which gave him Ground of Miſtruſt. For, he would always place
himſelf, as near as he could, to a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Table in the Chamber, where the
<hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal</hi> gives Audience. There is a Drawer un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der this Table, which
commonly ſtands half open, it being the Place where all <hi>Petitioners</hi>
throw in their Bribes or Preſents; It not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſeemly for a
<hi>Prince</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> to take Mony himſelf. The
<hi>Cardinal</hi> obſerv'd, that this Spark always had his Eye glancing on
that Drawer, as if he coveted what was there con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained. However, he took no
Notice, but gave him all the Opportunities imaginable to do his Pleaſure;
yet, ſtill one Accident or other, <pb n="227" facs="tcp:99492:128"/>hinder'd the
Gentleman from executing his Deſign; which was, to borrow ſome of the Gold
that lay in that Drawer. At length it happ'ned, that the <hi>Cardinal</hi>
having appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſome Curious <hi>Pageants</hi> to be made in Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the
King's <hi>Birth-Day,</hi> he with ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral of the <hi>Courtiers,</hi>
ſtood looking out of the Windows, to ſee theſe Triuphant Shows paſs by.
The Gentleman taking this Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity, whilſt he thought all Eyes were
intent on the Gayeties without, ſlips to the Table, and takes out of the
Drawer a Bag of Gold, putting it up in his Pocket, and retiring to the Window
again. He imagined, that no Body had ſeen him, and therefore hugged himſelf
in the Thoughts of his Booty. When the <hi>Show</hi> was over, and the Company
withdrew from the Windows; after a while, they all took their Leave, and
departed: And, among the Reſt, this Gentleman Thief was going out. But the
<hi>Cardinal</hi> deſired him to tarry, in that he had ſomething to ſay
to him. The Gentleman, ſtung with the guilt of what he had done, fell a
trembling, and was ready to drop down at the <hi>Cardinal</hi>'s Feet. But, he
bid him be of good Comfort, ſaying thus to him; <hi>My Friend, what thou
haſt done, is not hid from me. If thou hast not Gold enough, I will double
thy Sum.</hi> Therewith, he gave him another Bag of equal Value; ſaying
withall, <hi>Go thy Way, and ſee my Face no more. I par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, but canont
truſt thee.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="226" facs="tcp:99492:128"/>Wouldſt thou know, by what Means the
<hi>Cardinal</hi> diſcovered this Theft? He always wears on his Finger a
Ring, in which is ſet a <hi>Jewel</hi> of Ineſtimable Value; it being a
<hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Mirror,</hi> and diſcovering all Things that are done in the
Room, though behind a Man's Back. 'Twas on this Stone the <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal</hi>
caſt his Eye, when the Gentleman thought he was looking out of the Window.
Therein he beheld him go to the Table, take out the Money, and put it in his
Pocket. Thou ſeeſt how curious this <hi>Miniſter</hi> is, to ſtock
himſelf with uſeful Rarities.</p>
               <p>May that <hi>Great Chancellour</hi> of <hi>Heaven,</hi> the
<hi>Angel</hi> who beholds in the <hi>Divine Eſſence,</hi> as in a
<hi>Mirror,</hi> whatſoever is done on Earth, and records all Human Actions
in the <hi>Book</hi> of <hi>Judgment,</hi> never diſcern any Thing in
<hi>Mahmut,</hi> which may render him worthy to be excluded the
<hi>Preſence</hi> of <hi>God.</hi>

and who had ſtain'd the <hi>Records</hi> of <hi>Scotland,</hi> with the
<hi>Blood</hi> of many of their <hi>Kings.</hi> But, Innocency is void of
Suſpicion; and therefore, becauſe his own Intentions were ſincere, he
knew not how to be Jealous of others.</p>
               <p>However, the <hi>Scots</hi> at Firſt, ſeem'd to act the
Parts of <hi>Loyal</hi> Men. And, when they were threatned by the <hi>Engliſh

iſſued out againſt their Proceedings; they continued to aſſert the
Juſtice of their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portment, in receiving and defending their Injur'd
<hi>King,</hi> who had fled to them for Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="230" facs="tcp:99492:130"/>They detained him thus, from the 4th. of
the 5th. <hi>Moon,</hi> of the Year 1646. to the 30th. Day of the 1ſt.
<hi>Moon,</hi> of this preſent Year. At which time, having agreed with the
<hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh Parliament,</hi> for the Sum of 400000 <hi>Sequins,</hi> as the

               <p>The <hi>French Ambaſſador,</hi> was at that time in the
<hi>Scotch</hi> Army: Who having been a a Witneſs of their Deteſtable
Perjury, took his leave: And being attended with a <hi>Guard</hi> of
<hi>Light-Horſe</hi> to the Sea-Port, at parting he pull'd out a Piece of
<hi>Engliſh</hi> Money, valued at <hi>Half</hi> a <hi>Crown;</hi> And asking
the <hi>Captain</hi> of the <hi>Guards,</hi> into how many Pieces of Coined

Thirty. For ſo much,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied the <hi>Ambaſſador, did</hi> Judas
<hi>betray his</hi> Maſter.</p>
               <p>Thou wilt better comprehend the Force of this <hi>Repartee,</hi>
when thou conſidereſt, that according to the <hi>Chriſtians Belief,</hi>
this <hi>Judas</hi> was a <hi>Slave</hi> of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> the <hi>Son</hi>

Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biguous, than the <hi>Oracles</hi> of <hi>Delphos.</hi> As if they thought,
not only to circumvent Men by their Equivocations; but alſo, to deceive

<hi>Hatto,</hi> a <hi>German Biſhop,</hi> whoſe Perjury is recorded. This

               <p>The Bargain being concluded, the <hi>Biſhop</hi> went to

               <p>When they had rode about Half a League from the

of Moment, which he had left behind him in his Chamber, they return'd back to
the <hi>Caſtle:</hi> And, when they had found the Papers, they ſet forward
again toward the <hi>Emperor</hi>'s Camp. Being arrived there, the Impious

had perform'd his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, in carrying him back ſafe to the</hi> Caſtle,
<hi>when he returned to ſeek his Papers.</hi> Thus, was his Kinſman
betray'd by a Quibble, and loſt his Head. The <hi>Biſhop</hi> acquiring,

               <p>THIS <hi>City</hi> is peſtered, with an Innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Multitude
of <hi>Bats,</hi> and a Kind of <hi>Serpents,</hi> which they call
<hi>Lizards</hi> or <hi>Newts.</hi> They breed in the Walls of their Houſes,
and moleſt the Inhabitants Night and Day, ſwarming more than ordinary every
Ninth Year.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Pariſians</hi> give an odd Reaſon for this
<hi>Plague.</hi> They ſay, That in former Ages, a certain <hi>Magician</hi>
had undertaken to free this <hi>City,</hi> from all <hi>Venemous</hi>
Creatures; and, that accordingly, he had made ſeveral <hi>Images</hi> of
thoſe <hi>Animals,</hi> annexing to them <hi>Enchant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> and hiding
them in obſcure Places under the Earth; promiſing alſo, that ſo long as
thoſe <hi>Images</hi> remain'd untouch'd, <hi>Paris</hi> ſhould not be
moleſted with any Hurtful Thing. This ſucceeded according to his Words;
till, at a certain time, as they were digging up the Foundations of an Old
<hi>Temple,</hi> the Work-Men found ſeveral Brazen <hi>Images;</hi> ſome
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſenting a <hi>Bat,</hi> ſome a <hi>Lizard.</hi> They making ſmall
Account of theſe <hi>Magical Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques,</hi> ſold them to the next
<hi>Brazier</hi> for a piece of Money: Who, being ignorant alſo of the hidden
Force of theſe <hi>Images,</hi> melt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <pb n="235" facs="tcp:99492:132"/>them down for
his own Uſe. And, ever ſince that time, the City has been over-run with
<hi>Bats</hi> and <hi>Lizards.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I relate this to thee, in regard I have often heard thee ſpeak
of the Ancient <hi>Statues,</hi> that were in the <hi>Atmidan</hi> at
<hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and in other Parts of the City; particularly of that
<hi>Pillar,</hi> which had Three <hi>Brazen Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents</hi> winding about it;
which, when <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homet the Great</hi> beheld, the <hi>Conqueror</hi> ſtruck
One of them with a <hi>Battle-Axe,</hi> and ſmote off the <hi>Lower Jaw.</hi>
Upon which, a Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of <hi>Serpents</hi> infeſted the City; but, were
ſoon exterminated, in Regard the <hi>Sultan,</hi> being warned by the
Citizens, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bore to do any farther Injury to thoſe <hi>Images,</hi> which
were the <hi>Guardians</hi> of the City.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Annals</hi> of the <hi>Muſſulman Empire,</hi> make
Mention of theſe <hi>Statues,</hi> as alſo of a <hi>Horſe</hi> of
<hi>Braſs,</hi> and a <hi>Bull</hi> of the ſame Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal: The <hi>One</hi>
erected as a <hi>Charm</hi> againſt the <hi>Peſtilence;</hi> the
<hi>Other,</hi> as an <hi>Oraculous</hi> Sign, that the Enemies of the
<hi>Grecian Monarchy,</hi> ſhould in that Place be repulſed, and driven out
of the City. Yet, it proved otherwiſe: For, the Victorious
<hi>Muſſulmans,</hi> againſt whom the <hi>Enchantments</hi> of the
<hi>Infidels</hi> could not prevail, entred the <hi>Market-Place,</hi> where
this <hi>Image</hi> ſtood, and drove from thence the timorous
<hi>Grecians;</hi> cutting in Pieces all that made Reſiſtance, and rendring
themſelves <hi>Lords</hi> of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> at that Time the
Richeſt City in the World.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="236" facs="tcp:99492:133"/>The <hi>Romans</hi> were extremely
addicted to theſe <hi>Superſtitious</hi> Vanities: Believing, the Safety of
their <hi>City</hi> and <hi>Empire,</hi> conſiſted in the Preſervation of
the <hi>Palladium,</hi> and <hi>Image</hi> which they thought fell down from
<hi>Jupiter,</hi> and was tranſported from <hi>Troy</hi> to <hi>Italy</hi> by
<hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neas;</hi> being afterwards repoſited in the <hi>Temple</hi> of
<hi>Veſta,</hi> but burnt in that dreadful <hi>Conflagra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> which
happen'd in the <hi>Reign</hi> of <hi>Nero.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They had in no leſs <hi>Veneration,</hi> the
<hi>Buck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler,</hi> which they were taught, drop'd down from <hi>Heaven,</hi>
into the Hands of <hi>Numa Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pilius;</hi> whereon, the <hi>Fate</hi> of
<hi>Rome</hi> was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graven, in <hi>Characters</hi> which none could read.
Fearing leſt this <hi>Sacred Shield</hi> might be ſtoln, they caus'd Eleven
others of the ſame Figure to be made, and all to be hung up together in the
<hi>Temple</hi> of <hi>Mars.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And, to the End the <hi>Guardian Genius</hi> of the
<hi>City,</hi> ſhould not be entic'd from them by the <hi>Enchantments</hi>
of their Enemies, the <hi>True Name</hi> of the City of <hi>Rome</hi> was kept
Secret, even from its own Inhabitants: Inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much, that <hi>Valerius
Soranus</hi> was put to Death, for publiſhing it to one of his Friends. Many
have gueſs'd at this <hi>hidden Name;</hi> Some ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, it was
<hi>Valencia;</hi> Others, that it was <hi>Velia;</hi> a Third Sort, call it
<hi>Anthuſa.</hi> But, there is no Certainty in their Conjectures. For, the
<hi>Pagans</hi> were above all Things care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, to conceal the <hi>Names</hi>
of their <hi>Cities</hi> and <hi>Patron-Gods:</hi> knowing, that thoſe
<hi>Spirits</hi> would not forſake them, till they were call'd forth by their
<hi>Proper Names.</hi>

               <p>
                  <pb n="237" facs="tcp:99492:133"/>They us'd alſo, to chain the
<hi>Images</hi> of their <hi>Gods</hi> to the <hi>Altars,</hi> leſt they
ſhould depart from them by Stealth. Thus the <hi>Tyrians,</hi> when

               <p>According to the Orders which I receiv'd from the <hi>Vizir
Azem,</hi> I took a Journey to <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leans</hi> laſt <hi>Moon:</hi> Where,
on the Third Day af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter my Arrival, beholding a Solemn <hi>Proceſſion</hi>
in the Streets of that Populous <hi>City,</hi> attended with ſome uncommon
Ceremonies and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycings, my Curioſity prompted me to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire the
Occaſion of it. Thou maiſt ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, I did not apply my ſelf for
Informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Multitude, who take up Things on the Common Credit of Fame,
which does not always deliver the Truth. I ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs'd my ſelf to thoſe,
that were acquainted with the <hi>Records</hi> of the <hi>Town;</hi> who told
me, That this <hi>Solemnity</hi> was yearly obſerv'd, on the 
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:99492:135"/>Eighth Day of the Fifth <hi>Moon,</hi> in Memory of their
Deliverance from the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> who beſieged this <hi>City,</hi> and
were beaten from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it by <hi>Joan d' Arc,</hi> a <hi>Maid</hi> of
<hi>Lorrain,</hi> in the Reign of <hi>Charles</hi> I. This <hi>Virago,</hi>
ſeem'd to be the <hi>Tutelar Angel</hi> of <hi>France:</hi> For, to her
Valour and Conduct, that <hi>Monarch</hi> ow'd the Recovery of his
<hi>Kingdom,</hi> almoſt loſt to the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>England;</hi>
this being the laſt Place of Importance, which had not received
<hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh</hi> Garriſons. After ſhe had rais'd the Siege, ſhe
purſu'd the Enemy, gave them ſeveral Battels, defeated them, took their
<hi>Generals</hi> Captive, reduc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

all the Cities to their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Obedience, and never ſheath'd her Sword, till
ſhe ſaw her <hi>Maſter</hi> ſolemnly crown'd at <hi>Rhemes.</hi> Yet,
at length, ſhe herſelf was made a Priſoner by the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and
was publickly burnt for a <hi>Witch</hi> at <hi>Rouen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Inhabitants of <hi>Orleans,</hi> have erected <hi>Brazen
Statues</hi> in her Honour: They cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brate her Praiſes, and eſteem her, a
Woman <hi>Divinely Inſpir'd,</hi> to ſave her Country. Yet, the more
Intelligent Sort ſay, That ſhe was neither <hi>Witch</hi> nor
<hi>Propheteſs,</hi> but only a <hi>Maid</hi> of good Wit and Courage, whom
ſome of the <hi>Princes</hi> of the <hi>Blood-Royal,</hi> had inſtructed to
act the Part of a <hi>Miſſionary</hi> from <hi>Heaven;</hi> That ſo by
pretending <hi>Viſions</hi> and <hi>Revelations,</hi> ſhe might raiſe the
Courage of the <hi>French,</hi> now almoſt diſpirited by their many
Loſſes; and, whom Nothing leſs than a <hi>Miracle</hi> could perſwade
to abide the Field againſt the Victorious <hi>Engliſh.</hi> This is
cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, <pb n="242" facs="tcp:99492:136"/>that ſhe diſtinguiſh'd the <hi>King,</hi>
though diſguiſed like a <hi>Peaſant,</hi> and in a Crowd of People: She
went boldly up to him, and ſaluted him by his <hi>Title,</hi> to the
Aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of thoſe that ſtood by. She ſent a Meſſenger to
bring her a Sword of Antique Workmanſhip, that lay hid in a <hi>Tomb</hi> in
one their famous <hi>Moſques</hi> (for, the <hi>Nazarenes</hi> of the
<hi>Weſt,</hi> bury their <hi>Dead</hi> in their <hi>Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples.</hi>) This
Action extreamly enhanced her Reputation; in Regard, none knew of this Sword
but the King himſelf. She was there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore look'd upon, as an Extraordinary
Perſon; and, the People could hardly be reſtrain'd, from paying her
<hi>Divine</hi> Honours.</p>
               <p>When they were Encamped on a certain Plain of a vaſt Extent,
where there was no Water to be found, ſo that the Army was ready to periſh
through Thirſt; the King came to the <hi>Tent</hi> of this
<hi>Propheteſs,</hi> to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult her as an <hi>Oracle</hi> in the General
Diſtreſs. She bid Him be of good Courage, and follow her. They went out
together to the Door of her <hi>Tent,</hi> where at a little Diſtance there
grew a Knot of Flowers. The Admirable <hi>Maid,</hi> ſtruck her Spear into
the Ground a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midſt the Flowers, and incontinently there ſprung forth a
Fountain of Water, to which the whole Army repaired to allay their Thirſt.
They ſay, the Place is ſhown to this Day, with an Image of this
<hi>Maid</hi> ſtanding in an <hi>Oratory</hi> cloſe by it; a Place of
Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhment and <hi>Devotion</hi> for Travellers, that paſs over thoſe
barren Plains.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="243" facs="tcp:99492:136"/>However, whether it were Artifice, or that
ſhe was endued with ſome <hi>Supernatural</hi> Gift; it had a marvellous
Influence on the Soldiers, who began to reaſſume Courage, and feared
nothing under the Conduct of ſuch a <hi>General.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>'Twas Revenge, without Doubt, rather than Juſtice, that
extorted that <hi>Cruel Sentence</hi> from the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> which put a
Period to the <hi>Heroick</hi> Actions of this Illuſtrious <hi>Maid,</hi>
whoſe Fame will live for ever.</p>
               <p>It is recorded, That whilſt ſhe was bound faſt to the
Stake with ſtrong Cords, they would have kindled the Fire upon her before
ſhe had ſpoke to the Spectators; but, that ſhe ſuddenly became
looſned, and ſnatching a Lance from one of the Soldiers, ſhe drove the
<hi>Guards</hi> before her: Then returning of her own Accord to the Stake,
ſhe made her laſt Dying Speech, foretelling many Things to come, which
afterwards prov'd true. And having made an End of ſpeaking, ſhe bid the
<hi>Executioner</hi> ſet Fire to the Wood. Which he did accordingly, and
ſhe was burnt to Aſhes.</p>
               <p>Certainly, every <hi>Nation</hi> may boaſt of ſome
<hi>Female</hi> Warriour, that at one Time or other, has done remarkable
Service to her Country. And, thou art not a Stranger to the <hi>Hiſtory</hi>
of the <hi>Amazons,</hi> who excluded Men from their Society, yet became
formidable to all the Regions round about them.</p>

               <p>THou art the Man that muſt participate in all my Adventures.
And, I ſhould be a Churle, in not letting thee ſhare with me, the
Pleaſure I found in a late Journey to <hi>Orleans,</hi> one of the
<hi>Preſidiary</hi> Towns of <hi>France.</hi> It was by the Order of the
<hi>Vizir Azem,</hi> I undertook that Journey. Some bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy had informed Him,
That this Town was full of Merchant-Travellers of ſeveral <hi>Nations,</hi>
but eſpecially of <hi>Germany,</hi> who brought the choiceſt Jewels of the
<hi>Eaſt,</hi> to vend in this Place at ordinary Rates. That
<hi>Miniſter</hi> gave me Commands, to buy certain Stones; with
Inſtructions to treat of another Affair, which it is not neceſſary for
thee to know. I accordingly ſet out from <hi>Paris,</hi> the Third Day of the
5th. <hi>Moon;</hi> and, <hi>Fliachim</hi> the <hi>Jew</hi> (of whom thou
haſt heard) bore me Company.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="245" facs="tcp:99492:137"/>I need not deſcribe to thee, the Country
through which we paſs'd: It exactly reſemb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth the <hi>Plains</hi> of St.
<hi>Iſidore,</hi> not far from <hi>Palermo</hi> in <hi>Sicily.</hi> Thou and
I, have Reaſon to remember that Place of our <hi>Captivity,</hi> car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying
the Marks of our <hi>Maſter</hi>'s Cruel Anger yet in our Bodies. Thoſe
<hi>Plains,</hi> thou know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, afford a very agreeable Proſpect;
eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally at this Time of the Year, when the Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure of the Trees, mixed
with the Bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Corn-fields, and the parti coloured Meadows,
tempt the Eye into a Controverſy of Pleaſure; a Man neither knowing well
how to take it off, nor yet where to fix it, in ſuch an Orderly Confuſion
and Medley of Charming Objects.</p>
               <p>Such is the <hi>Province</hi> between <hi>Paris</hi> and
<hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leans;</hi> which has this Advantage of thoſe <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilian
Plains,</hi> That here all the Way one rides, Innumerable Magnificent and
Beautiful Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laces appear, ſhooting up their glittering Turrets above the
lofty Groves, which envi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron thoſe <hi>Seats</hi> of <hi>Pleaſure.</hi>
Indeed, this is one of the pureſt Airs, and the moſt fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile Soil in all
the Kingdom; which invites the <hi>Nobles</hi> and <hi>Gentry,</hi> to reſide
here during the <hi>Summer,</hi> and occaſions much Travelling on his
Road.</p>
               <p>About Mid-day, we came to a Town called <hi>Chaſtres,</hi>
where we alighted to refreſh our ſelves. Travellers in theſe
<hi>Weſtern</hi> Parts, are better accommodated with Proviſions, than they
can be in <hi>Aſia,</hi> where they muſt carry their own Beds with them,
and dreſs their <pb n="246" facs="tcp:99492:138"/>own Victuals, or lie on the naked Floor
faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. This makes the <hi>Nazarenes,</hi> call the <hi>Eaſt</hi>
Inhoſpitable. They conſider not at the ſame Time, that 'tis the
Niceneſs and Delicacy of the <hi>Mahometans,</hi> which occaſions this
Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom. For, the <hi>Eaſtern</hi> People, are fearful of defiling
themſelves, by eating Meat pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared by other Hands than their own, or
thoſe of their Servants: As alſo, to lie on a Bed, common to all
Paſſengers.</p>
               <p>But, theſe <hi>Infidels</hi> are like the <hi>Swine,</hi> to
whom all Meat is Welcom, and every Ditch an Acceptable Bed. Here are Inns all
along the Roads, whereinto when you enter, the <hi>Hoſt</hi> provides you
both Bed and all other Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſaries. A Man muſt venture to ſleep on the
ſame Pillow, where perhaps a <hi>Leper</hi> has lain the Night before, or
ſome Perſon Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted with a worſe Diſeaſe. The <hi>Hoſt</hi>
exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines none, but harbours all alike, provided they have Mony to pay him. And
as for Victuals, 'tis the Cuſtom for all Travellers, to eat together at one
Common Table, where ſeveral Diſhes of Meat are ſerved up, and every Man
is free to eat what and how much he pleaſes, paying a ſtated Price for his
Din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</p>
               <p>Thus, no ſooner were we come into our Inn at
<hi>Chaſtres,</hi> but the <hi>Hoſt</hi> ſaluting us af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Manner of
the Country, invited us to ſit down at the <hi>Ordinary,</hi> (for ſo they
call their Publick Dinner in an Inn.) We were not ſo ſcrupulous as to
refuſe his Offer, but followed him into the Chamber, where the 
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:99492:138"/>Dinner was prepared. There were many Gueſts at the
Table, and all buſie in feeding themſelves. We took ſuch Seats as we
found vacant, and without much Ceremony fell to eating. The <hi>Jew</hi>
truſted to the Indulgence of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and I to that of
<hi>Mahomet,</hi> for eating with the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncircumciſed,</hi> whoſe Meat
is ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom free from the <hi>Pollutions</hi> of <hi>Blood.</hi> We knew, that
neither <hi>God</hi> nor his <hi>Prophets,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired us to ſtarve.</p>
               <p>There was Plenty of Wine, and that ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious, as would
have tempted an <hi>Hogia</hi> to taſte it, without the <hi>Mufti</hi>'s
Diſpenſation. To avoid Singularity, I made a Shew of eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as the
Reſt; but, the greateſt Part of my Repaſt, conſiſted in Bread and
ſome Fruits, with that exhilarating Juice of the Grape.</p>
               <p>The honeſt <hi>Jew</hi> ſwore, 'twas a Banquet prepared by
<hi>Cupid,</hi> to render him the moſt Miſerable of all Men. For, juſt in
the Midſt of our Mirth, came in a <hi>French</hi> Gentleman with a Lady in
his Hand, who placed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves at the Table exactly oppoſite to us. I
perceived evident Symptoms of ſome Diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in <hi>Eliachim,</hi> who
ſeem'd to read his <hi>Fate,</hi> in that fair Creatures Face; yet had not
Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to check his Wandering Eyes, or guard 'em from Inevitable Wounds. He'd
almoſt acted o'er the <hi>Story</hi> of the <hi>Aegyptian</hi> Wives, whom
<hi>Joſeph</hi>'s Miſtreſs had invited to behold his Beauty: they cut
their Fingers for their Meat, whilſt gazing on the Charming Youth: So, poor
<hi>Eliachim</hi> was all Confuſion, turn'd to a <pb n="248" facs="tcp:99492:139"/>Statue, whilſt he looked on this enchanting <hi>Gorgon.</hi> He had
forgot to eat or drink, till I began to rowze him from his Dream. I told him
ſoftly in the Ear, This Lady was but the Younger Siſter of <hi>Ixion</hi>'s
Miſtriſs. This brought him to his Sence again, but could not reſtore his
Peace. Prudence taught him, to diſſemble the violent Emotion of his Soul,
and not to expoſe himſelf in ſuch a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany; but, Nothing could expell
the Fatal Poyſon from his Breaſt.</p>
               <p>When we had ſufficiently repoſed our ſelves, we bid adieu
to the Inn; all joyning Company, and ſetting forward to <hi>Orleans.</hi> On
the Road, both <hi>Eliachim</hi> and I, had many Opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of converſing
with this Young Lady; ſuch Familiarity with Women, being allowed in
<hi>France.</hi> We found her Wit ſurprizing as her Beauty; and, her Mien and
Conduct, ſuch as gave Advantage to them both. In a Word, <hi>Eliachim</hi>
was loſt amidſt ſo many Perfections.</p>
               <p>When we came to our Inn at Night, and were in our Chamber
together, he vented his Paſſion in theſe Words. Mahmut, <hi>I've paſs'd
theſe Years hitherto, without any other Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Love, ſave thoſe
which in General I owe to all our Race, and ſome more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Regards of
Friendſhip and Duty. But, ſince I ſaw this lovely Creature, methinks my
Friends, and all that ought to be beloved on Earth, is now contracted into her.
'Tis not her Snowy Skin or Matchleſs Features, are of Force to move me;
though they are ſuch, <pb n="249" facs="tcp:99492:139"/>thy ſelf being Judge, as would
have ſoiled</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelles <hi>Art to imitate: but, 'tis a Luſtre which I
can't expreſs! Surely, 'twas Lightning darted from her Eyes, thoſe fair
Avenues of her brighter Soul! The ſubtle Flame, glanced through my Breaſt,
and in a Moment ſcorch'd my Reaſon up! The lovely</hi> Baſilisk,
<hi>ſhot Deaths at every Look: Thou ſaweſt how I ſate as one
transformed; ſo lifeleſs and without motion was I, whilſt gazing on my
Ruine! And, to this Hour, a Fatal Numbneſs ſpreads though all my Veins, as
if I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>d touch'd ſome dire</hi>
Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedo.</p>
               <p>Thus went he raving on, till I interrupted him with Laughter and
Raillery, endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to cure him of this Love-ſick Humour, by ridiculing
it. I told him my own Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of this Fooliſh <hi>Paſſion,</hi>
rehearſed my former Adventures with <hi>Daria,</hi> and how at length I got
the Victory of this vain Fond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, by Abſence, and the Exerciſe of my
Reaſon. But, all that I could ſay, made no Impreſſion on the ſtupid
Lover. He grew but worſe, and ſo I left him to ſeek Repoſe from
Sleep.</p>
               <p>We came not to <hi>Orleans</hi> till the next Day, where we
tarried not long, having no other Buſineſs, as it happen'd, but to ſee
the Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities of the Town, and inform our ſelves of thoſe Things, it is
convenient for Travellers to know. After which, we returned to <hi>Paris;</hi>
I, with the ſame Sentiments I had at my firſt ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting out from thence;
but, it ſeems, the <hi>World</hi> was Metamorphoſed in poor
<hi>Eliachim</hi>'s <pb n="250" facs="tcp:99492:140"/>Opinion: To him the Trees had now
loſt all their Greenneſs; the Flowers, and Graſs, and Corn look'd
wither'd; the Birds ſung mournful Notes; the Winds blew hoarſe unwelcome
Sounds; and, every Thing in <hi>Nature,</hi> ſeemed to him to droop,
becauſe <hi>Falante</hi> was not there (ſo was the Fair one called,) as
<hi>Eliachim</hi> had learned of her, when we parted from <hi>Orleans.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In this melancholy Condition, the poor Brain-ſick <hi>Jew</hi>
has continued ever ſince. When his Cure will commence, I know not.</p>
               <p>If thou yet retaineſt thy Native Liberty, and haſt not
ſacrificed it to Unhappy Love, learn by his Misfortune to watch thy
<hi>Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,</hi> which are the Firſt <hi>Traytors</hi> to the <hi>Soul.</hi>

Or, does the <hi>Book</hi> of <hi>Glory</hi> teach us <hi>Arrogance?</hi>
Surely, my Traducers will bluſh, when they ſhall conſider, That Our

<hi>Kings</hi> on <hi>Earth</hi>) when they vouchſafe to write to
<hi>Chriſtian</hi> Princes, they dictate their Letters in a Style, full of

both <hi>Here</hi> and in <hi>Paradiſe.</hi> And, would it 
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:99492:144"/>become a <hi>Slave,</hi> to treat <hi>Crown'd Heads</hi>
with leſs Reſpect, than does the <hi>Maſter</hi> of the
<hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſe?</hi> If I have contracted Friendſhip with ſome of the
<hi>Chriſtian Derviſes,</hi> it was to ſerve the Ends of the <hi>Sublime
Port,</hi> and perform the Rites of Gratitude. I thought it no Crime, to
receive a Kindneſs from any Man, or to return it, without examining his
<hi>Religion.</hi> But, perhaps they ſuſpect the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timacies I had with
<hi>Cardinal Richlieu,</hi> and ſtill have with his Succeſſor
<hi>Mazarini.</hi> Reſt aſſured, O <hi>Holy Derviſe,</hi> That my
Acceſs to theſe <hi>Princes</hi> of the <hi>Roman Church,</hi> is ſo far
from being Criminal, that without it I never had been capable of penetrating
into the Counſels of the <hi>Infidels,</hi> nor of doing any effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual
Service to the <hi>Grand Signior.</hi> The Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance which my Familiarity
with theſe Two Great <hi>Miniſters</hi> affords me, has all along
faci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litated my Deſigns. And, whilſt, under their Umbrage, I am taken for a

Arches, for the Victorious <hi>Muſſulmans.</hi> 'Tis ſtrange, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks,
that after all this, I ſhould be ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected! That notwithſtanding, I
have pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently endur'd Nine Years Confinement, to an Obſcure and Private
Life; a Melancholy Baniſhment, to a Strange Country; yea, to a City, for
which I have a Natural Averſion; a City the moſt Unclean, Noiſy and Vain
in the whole Earth; to be ſhut up, for the Sake of avoiding Diſcovery, in a
Chamber ſo Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, <pb n="259" facs="tcp:99492:144"/>that <hi>Suſpicion</hi> it
ſelf, nay, even <hi>Thought,</hi> the <hi>Mother</hi> of that Little
<hi>Paſſion,</hi> would ſweat and be ſtifled, when once Circumſcrib'd
within theſe Walls; and after all this, to be made a <hi>Priſoner</hi> of
<hi>State,</hi> on Jealouſy of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a <hi>Mahometan:</hi> To abide that
Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſo many <hi>Moons,</hi> unmov'd, uncorrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and at length to
be releaſed, to the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Intereſt; and yet,
to be traduc'd at Home, for a <hi>Traytor</hi> to <hi>God,</hi> his
<hi>Prophet,</hi> and my <hi>Sovereign,</hi> has ſurely ſomething in it of
Inconſiſtent.</p>
               <p>What is then my Crime? Or, why am I thus aſpers'd? Let my
Slanderers hereafter be ſilent. Unleſs they will lay it to my Charge, That
in ſome of my Letters, I have diſcover'd a Mind free from
<hi>Superſtition;</hi> That I put a high Value on Reaſon, and have no low
Eſteem, for ſome of the Ancient <hi>Philoſophers;</hi> That I endeavour
to guard my Sence, and will not ſuffer it to be muzzled with the
Impoſitions of Ignorance and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice; That I do not think it a
Neceſſary Qualification of a <hi>Muſſulman,</hi> to purſue with
Inexorable Hatred, all Men that differ from me in Opinion. In fine, That in all
my Converſation, I ſtrive to comport my ſelf, as One who aſſerts the
<hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity</hi> of the <hi>Divine Eſſence,</hi> the <hi>Plurality</hi> of
his <hi>Prophets,</hi> the <hi>Determinate Number</hi> of the <hi>Elect;</hi>
and, who is reſolv'd and prepar'd, rather to die a Thouſand Deaths, than
voluntarily to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit any <hi>Impiety</hi> againſt theſe
<hi>Principles,</hi> or the <hi>Intereſt</hi> of the <hi>Grand Signior,</hi>
who has a <pb n="260" facs="tcp:99492:145"/>
                  <hi>Right</hi> to command all <hi>Mankind.</hi>
If theſe be Crimes, I muſt own my ſelf Culpable: If not, let my
Accuſers lay their Hand upon their Mouth. And continue thou, <hi>Sage
Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor</hi> of our <hi>Holy Law,</hi> to inſtruct me with thy Counſels, to
aſſiſt me with thy Prayers, and to protect me with thy Friendſhip. Then
ſhall <hi>Mahmut</hi> perſevere a <hi>True Believer,</hi> a Faithful
<hi>Slave</hi> to the <hi>Oſman Emperor,</hi> and a Devout Admirer of thy
Longevity and Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue.</p>
               <p>I ſhould fear, this might be the laſt Letter I ſhould have
the Honour to ſend thee, were I not convinced by ſome near Examples, That
Old Age was not reſtrained to the Times before the <hi>Flood.</hi> Though
thou haſt far out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs'd the ordinary Years of Men, yet there is at this
Time, not far from <hi>Paris,</hi> a Man who has near doubled thy Age. He is an
<hi>Hermit,</hi> living on a Hill, where all Things neceſſary for Human
Suſtenance ſeem to be wanting. The Walls of his Houſe are built of Mud,
with his own Hands (a weak Defence againſt Wind and Rains.) His Bed is
compoſed of Leaves of Trees. A Stone ſerves him for his Pillow. His Diet
conſiſts of ſuch Herbs and Fruits, as that Mountain affords him. A
neighbouring Well, allays his Thirſt. He has dwelt in this Place, and in this
Manner, Eighty Three Years, after he had Travelled moſt Parts of
<hi>Europe</hi> and <hi>Aſia.</hi> Ask him by what Means he preſerv'd his
Life ſo long, he anſwers, <hi>By living free from Care, and by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Indifferent to all Things.</hi> He foretells <pb n="261" facs="tcp:99492:145"/>Things to
come with marvellous Succeſs, as has been often obſerv'd. Which makes the
People eſteem him a <hi>Prophet.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>French</hi> tell me of another, who lived longer than
he, being Three Hundred Sixty and One Years Old when he died. He was call'd,
<hi>John of the Times,</hi> in Regard he liv'd from the <hi>Reign</hi> of
<hi>Charles the Great,</hi> to that of the <hi>Emperor Conrade.</hi> And, being
ask'd, What Diet he uſed, his Anſwer was, <hi>Honey within, and Oil
without.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This comforts me with the Hopes of ſeeing thee on Earth, tho'
many Years hence: Since, no Man can exceed thee in Abſtinence, So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briety, and
the Calmneſs of thy Mind.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Great Author</hi> of <hi>Life</hi> ſo grant, That if I
may not enjoy this Felicity <hi>Here,</hi> yet I may not, by any enormous
Crimes, merit to be excluded thy Society in <hi>Paradiſe.</hi>

               <p>THE <hi>French</hi> are puffed up, with the late Defeat they

know no Bounds, were it not curb'd by the Loſs of the <hi>Duke</hi> of

               <p>The Young <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Conde,</hi> has been alſo
forced to withdraw his Army from before <hi>Lerida;</hi> that Place, being ever

               <p>But, the News from the <hi>Levant,</hi> has ela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted all the

than of any real Succeſs againſt the <hi>Invincible Oſmans.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is reported, That there have been Two <hi>Sea-Fights,</hi>
between our <hi>Fleets</hi> and the <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netians;</hi> that in the Former, we
loſt Two Thouſand Men, Seven Galleys and a <hi>Baſſa;</hi> that in the

               <p>The <hi>Chriſtians</hi> every where expreſs great Joy for

               <p>From <hi>Dalmatia,</hi> the <hi>Poſts</hi> bring daily News of

of <hi>Xemonido, Novigrade, Nadin, Carin,</hi> and all the <hi>Places</hi> of
<hi>Strength</hi> which we had in our Poſſeſſion, except

Two Thouſand Men, and at Length were forced to leave our Camp to the
<hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians;</hi> our <hi>General</hi> being frighted away by a few

               <p>It ſeems Strange and Ominous to me, that thoſe Arms, which
have formerly cruſh'd the Greateſt <hi>Monarchies</hi> to Pieces, and have
chang'd the Face of the whole Earth, ſhould now be foil'd by a few
<hi>Deſperado's!</hi> I dare be thus far a <hi>Prophet,</hi> That either the

our Armies muſt needs miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carry during his Reign; moſt of the Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers,
being offended at his Licentious Life, and Cruel Actions. Beſides, they tax
him with Profuſeneſs, in that he has not ſpared the Private Treaſury of
Gold, which, by the Frugality of his <hi>Predeceſſors,</hi> had been
heap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed together; and, which it was not count<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed lawful for them to touch,
unleſs in the utmoſt Peril of the <hi>Empire.</hi> They ſay, that by the
Additions which <hi>Sultan Amurat</hi> had made, this Treaſure was augmented
to above Thirty Millions of <hi>Sequins:</hi> But, that our preſent
<hi>Emperor,</hi> has ſquandred moſt of it away, on his Pleaſure. They
compare him to <hi>Heliogabalus,</hi> the moſt Effeminate <hi>Prince</hi>
that ever Reign'd: Praiſing at the ſame Time, the Magnanimity and Valour of
<hi>Sultan Amurat;</hi> who, they ſay, was the Stouteſt Man on Earth. They
highly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaud his Bravery at the <hi>Siege</hi> of <hi>Babylon,</hi> when he
accepted the Challenge of the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſian</hi> Soldier; and entering into a
ſingle Combat with the Unhappy <hi>Redhead,</hi> at one Blow, with his
<hi>Sabre,</hi> cleft him (though in <hi>Armour</hi>) to the Middle. In
Memorial whereof, thou knoweſt, that <hi>Armour</hi> hangs to this Day in the
<hi>Hazoda.</hi> In fine, they <pb n="265" facs="tcp:99492:147"/>extoll his Juſtice:
Whereof he gave a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable Inſtance, in puniſhing a certain
<hi>Hogia,</hi> who had cheated a <hi>Pilgrim</hi> of his <hi>Jewels.</hi> Thou
remembreſt that Paſſage. And, the <hi>Stone-Mortar,</hi> wherein that
Miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Wretch was pounded alive by his Own <hi>Sentence,</hi> is yet to
be ſeen at the Gate of the <hi>Divan,</hi> a Monument of his Villainy, and
the <hi>Sultan</hi>'s Juſtice.</p>
               <p>Theſe Things are not unknown in the <hi>Weſt:</hi> For, the
<hi>Nazarenes</hi> have their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligencers, in the <hi>Imperial</hi> City.
Hence they derive Occaſions, to Cenſure or Praiſe the Actions of our

becauſe a few Females appear'd on the Walls? Is this the Way to aggrandize

Nay, what do they not ſay already? The News of that Siege, had reach'd all

Army, to the Honour of their Arms; whilſt our In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>defatigable Soldiers, have
mounted on Heaps <pb n="267" facs="tcp:99492:148"/>of Slaughter'd <hi>Spahi's,</hi> and
ſcal'd the Battle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of their Enemies. Whereas thou, wert afraid of a few
Stones, that the Women hurl'd on thy Men from the Walls! Thou art more
effeminate than <hi>Sardanapalus!</hi> It were fitter for thee, to handle the
Diſtaff, and Spin for thy Bread, than to draw a Sword in the <hi>Field</hi>
of <hi>Honour.</hi> It is a wonder thy own Soldiers do not abandon thee, being
aſham'd to ſerve under ſo Weak a <hi>Commander.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I counſel thee, ſpeedily to recover thy loſt Reputation,
by ſome notable Service. Let not Perils affright thee; but remember, that
true Fortitude ſurmounts all Difficulties; and, that thou canſt not paſs
into the <hi>Temple</hi> of <hi>Honour,</hi> but through that of
<hi>Vertue.</hi> It is not my Part to project for thee: The whole Country is
before thee: Thou knoweſt, or at leaſt oughteſt to know, the Motions and
Strength of thy Enemies. Do ſomething ſpeedily, that ſhall ſpeak thee
Wiſe and Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant. Thou hadſt better loſe thy Life ſo, than by a

               <head>LETTER IV. To <hi>Achmet Baſſa.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>NOT long ago, arrived here a <hi>Courier</hi> from
<hi>Suedeland,</hi> bringing Letters from Queen <hi>Chriſtina,</hi> and
<hi>Monſieur Chanut,</hi> the <hi>French Reſident</hi> at
<hi>Stockholme.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Among other Matters, they give an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, That on the Twenty
Seventh Day of the Seventh <hi>Moon,</hi> that Great <hi>Princeſs</hi> had
like to have been ſtabb'd, in the Midſt of her <hi>Guards,</hi>
ſurrounded with her <hi>Courtiers,</hi> before the <hi>Altar</hi> of her
<hi>God;</hi> at an Hour, when all the <hi>Subjects</hi> of that
<hi>Kingdom,</hi> were on their Knees, to render <hi>Heaven</hi> Propitious to
<hi>Her</hi> and the <hi>Publick.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That Day, there was a <hi>Faſt</hi> proclaim'd through all
<hi>Suedeland;</hi> and, he was eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed no Good <hi>Subject,</hi> who did
not repair to the <hi>Publick Solemnities.</hi> The Queen, to give an Example,
went at the Third Hour of the Day to the <hi>Moſque</hi> of her
<hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace,</hi> attended by the <hi>Great Officers</hi> of <hi>State,</hi>
and a Numerous Train of the <hi>Nobility.</hi> When the <hi>Preacher</hi> (as
is the Cuſtom) had made an End of ſpeaking, all that were preſent fell on
their Knees, to perform the appointed <hi>Devotions.</hi> But, it being the
Faſhion of the <hi>Nazarenes,</hi> to utter ſome ſecret preparative
<hi>Oraiſons;</hi> the Men covered their Faces with their Hats, to be more
recollected.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="269" facs="tcp:99492:149"/>While all Eyes were thus veil'd, a certain
Fellow ſnatching the Opportunity, ſteps from his Place; and, without making
any great Noiſe, by large Strides, advances un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeen to the <hi>Rails</hi>
which encloſe the <hi>Pavement,</hi> next to the <hi>Altar,</hi> where the
<hi>Queen</hi> was on her Knees. But, in leaping over, he was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by a
certain <hi>Nobleman;</hi> who, imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately cryed out to the <hi>Guards, to
ſtop the Aſſaſſin.</hi> They croſs'd their Partiſans; but the
<hi>Villain,</hi> hurl'd them one againſt another with ſo great Violence,
that while they were ſtriving to recover their entangled Weapons, he got
quite through them. At which time, the <hi>Queen</hi> alſo raiſing her
ſelf up at the Noiſe, puſh'd the <hi>Captain</hi> of her <hi>Guards,</hi>
who kneeled beſide her. He ſtarting from his Place, leap'd between the
<hi>Queen</hi> and the <hi>Murderer,</hi> who was now within Two Paces of her.
He ſeizes the Wretch; and, upon immediate Search, they found Two long
ſharp-pointed Knives about him, without Sheaths; One in his Boſom, the
Other in his Pocket. The <hi>Priſon</hi> being in the <hi>Caſtle</hi> or
<hi>Palace</hi> of the <hi>Queen,</hi> under her very Apartment, ſhe was not
willing he ſhould be carried thither; but ordered him, to be reconducted to
his own Chamber, which was in the <hi>College</hi> of <hi>Stock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holme;</hi> he
being an <hi>Eccleſiaſtick</hi> of the ſaid <hi>College:</hi> Commanding
alſo, a good <hi>Guard</hi> to be ſet over him; which was performed
accordingly.</p>
               <p>As ſoon as the <hi>Wretch</hi> ſaw himſelf in his Chamber,
he ſaid aloud, <hi>That when he went <pb n="270" facs="tcp:99492:150"/>out in the
Morning, he little thought of ever-returning again; having undertaken an
Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, in doing of which, he expected to loſe his Life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They uſed all Diligence imaginable, in diſcovering the
Authors of this intended Murder; but, could learn Nothing more, than that this
Fellow was a <hi>Lunatick,</hi> whom at Certain <hi>Seaſons,</hi> an
Unaccountable Fury ſpur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red on to many Extravagancies.</p>
               <p>Yet ſome ſuſpect, that he was hired by the <hi>Lutheran
Clergy</hi> to give this Execrable Blow; who were apprehenſive, that the
<hi>Queen</hi> hearkning too much to the Inſinuations of her <hi>Tutor,</hi>
who was a <hi>Calviniſt,</hi> would Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate the <hi>Eſtabliſh'd
Religion</hi> of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try.</p>
               <p>If this be a well grounded Suſpicion, it follows at the
beſt, that <hi>Religion,</hi> which ought to correct the <hi>Morals</hi> of
Men, and have an Influence in reſtraining their Exorbitant Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, is
become the Corrupter of their Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and the Fomenter of the moſt
Enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Crimes. But, this is common among the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> who
being divided into Innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable <hi>Parties,</hi> diſtinguiſhed by as many
Several Names; yet each <hi>Sect</hi> is ſo ſure that their <hi>Way</hi> is
the only <hi>Right Path</hi> to <hi>Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> that they ſpare for
neither Murders, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crileges, nor Treaſons, to proſelyte the Reſt to
their Opinion; being unwilling, that any ſhould live, who are not of the
ſame Mind with them.</p>

               </head>
               <p>THOU haſt heap'd many Favours on me; yet I have never had an
Opportunity, of making the leaſt Acknowledgment. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept now a <hi>Small
Preſent</hi> from <hi>Mahmut</hi>'s Hands, who being not Maſter of Wealth,
can make no <hi>Great Ones.</hi> I ſend thee neither Silver, Gold, nor
Jewels, which the Inſatiable Avarice of Mortals, has violently torn from the
Bowels of their <hi>Common Mother.</hi> Neither ſhalt thou receive from me,
any of the more familiar Products of the Earth, ſuch as grow on her Surface.
Expect no choice Fruits, or Wine, or Oil; nor any thing framed by the Art of
Man, whether for Delight, or Uſe. What I ſend thee, is the <hi>Dew</hi> of
<hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,</hi> a certain <hi>Quinteſſence</hi> of the <hi>Elements,</hi>
an <hi>Aetherial Spirit,</hi> firſt condens'd into a Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pour, then into a
more liquid Subſtance, and afterwards congealed into a Gum. It is the
celebrated <hi>Manna</hi> of <hi>Calabria.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Adonai</hi> the <hi>Jew,</hi> ſent it to me out of
<hi>Italy,</hi> as a Rarity. I knew not whom ſo properly to oblige with this
Preſent, as the Studious of <hi>Natural</hi> Things, <hi>Haly</hi> the Sage
<hi>Phyſician,</hi> and my Friend.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="273" facs="tcp:99492:151"/>The <hi>Philoſopher Averroes,</hi> our
Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, has written much of this excellent Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance. He calls it, the
<hi>Food</hi> of the <hi>Airy An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels.</hi> And ſays, the Young
<hi>Ravens</hi> crying in their Neſts, are nouriſh'd by this Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Diet, when the Old Ones forſake them: And, that the <hi>Chamelions,</hi>
ſeek no other Repaſt during their Lives, but the Inviſible <hi>Manna</hi>
that every where floats in the Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Air. He holds it poſſible, That a
Man, after he has paſs'd his <hi>Great Climacter,</hi> may live without any
other Suſtenance, ſave what he receives from this <hi>Heavenly
Diſtillation;</hi> that he may thus prolong his Life, for the Space of Seven
Years, which will complete the appointed Age of Mortals. Many of the
ſublimely inſtructed among the <hi>Arabians,</hi> are of the ſame
Opinion; ſo are not a few of the <hi>Hebrew Rabbi's:</hi> But, the
<hi>Chriſtians,</hi> who are Gluttons, laugh at this Doctrine, as Ridiculous
and Impracticable: Forgetting at the ſame time, what they read in their
<hi>Bible</hi> (which they pretend is the <hi>Rule</hi> of their
<hi>Faith</hi>) that the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> had Nothing elſe to feed on,
for a conſiderable time, in the <hi>Deſart,</hi> when they were almoſt
Eight Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Thouſand Souls, and the Greateſt Part of them in their full
Strength, Men of Arms, and inur'd to the Toils of War.</p>
               <p>Certainly, it were a deſirable Thing, that this <hi>Divine
Largeſs,</hi> were diſtributed to all the Regions on Earth. But,
<hi>God</hi> ſends his Bleſſings to whom, and when he pleaſes. 'Tis he
that directeth the Clouds, when they <pb n="274" facs="tcp:99492:152"/>move through the
Air, and reſt not till they arrive at barren and dry Places, where they pour
forth their Water to refeſh the Earth, and render it fruitful. <hi>God!</hi>
There is but One <hi>God, Lord</hi> of the <hi>Worlds!</hi> Theſe are Signs
of his <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity</hi> to <hi>True Believers,</hi> but the
<hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credulous</hi> have hardned their Hearts.</p>
               <p>It is recorded, That in former Times, the Ground whereon this
<hi>Manna</hi> deſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, belong'd to a certain <hi>Nobleman</hi> of the
<hi>Country;</hi> who, covetous of the Unuſual <hi>Bleſſing,</hi>
undertook to encloſe all that Land with a high Wall, to the End that ſo
rare a Gift, might not be made Common to every one. But, as ſoon as the
Workmen had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun to lay the Foundations of this Encloſure, the
<hi>Manna</hi> ceas'd to fall, and ſo continued, as long as they proceeded in
that Envious work. Which, when the <hi>Lord</hi> of the <hi>Ground</hi> was
made ſenſible of, he commanded the Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men to deſiſt: Saying withal,
<hi>The</hi> Almighty <hi>gives, and the</hi> Almighty <hi>takes away.
Hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forward, I will not ſeek to reſtrain the Free Gift of</hi> Heaven.
Upon which, the <hi>Manna</hi> deſcended daily as before, and ſo has
continued to do ever ſince. Doubtleſs, this is a Sign of <hi>God's
Omnipotence.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If thou wilt permit me to play the <hi>Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher,</hi> I
will tell thee my Opinion, why this <hi>Manna</hi> is ſeen rather in the
<hi>Kingdom</hi> of <hi>Naples,</hi> than in any other <hi>Region</hi> of the
<hi>Earth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is well known, that the Earth of this Country, abounds with
Veins of Sulphur, which are diffuſed up and down through all 
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:99492:152"/>Parts, and heat the Soil to an Extraordinary Degree.
Hence it follows, that the <hi>Lower Region</hi> of the Air in this Country,
muſt needs acquire a greater Degree of Heat and Dryneſs alſo, being
perpetually rarified by the Fiery <hi>Atomes,</hi> which every where
tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire through the Pores of the Earth, as from a Furnace.</p>
               <p>This being ſo, it is not hard to conceive, that the Vapours
which are exhal'd by the Sun into the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pper Region,</hi> in the Heat of a
<hi>Summers</hi> Day, and there become Impregna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the <hi>Aetherial
Spirit,</hi> (which remains pure and uncloath'd in thoſe ſerener Tracts,
and conſequently, is apt to Incorporate with any proper Vehicle) Naturally
deſcend again in the Cool of the Night; but, not meeting with a Congenious
Body of Vapours, in the <hi>Lower Region,</hi> that Air being over-purify'd,
and grown defecate, through the too near Neighbourhood of the Burning Soil,
ſo that they cannot diffuſe themſelves through the Air for want of a fit
<hi>Medium,</hi> they conſiſting of <hi>Homogeneous</hi> Parts, and
following the Natural Poſition of the <hi>Element,</hi> and the <hi>Laws</hi>
of <hi>Gravity;</hi> contract themſelves into little Globular Forms the lower
they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend, thus ſetling on the Leaves of Trees, on the Graſs and
Herbs, on Stones and any Part of the Earth, appearing like Grains of
Tranſparent <hi>Gum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Hence alſo I conceive, That the ſame <hi>Manna</hi> (which
is Nothing elſe, but an <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therial Spirit,</hi> embodied in light and
dulcid <pb n="276" facs="tcp:99492:153"/>Vapours) abounds in the Air of moſt Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries,
but remains inviſible, rarely ſo far condens'd, as to ſettle in a groſs
Body on the Ground, becauſe the Air of thoſe Regions, is not ſo rarify'd
as is that of <hi>Calabria,</hi> having no ſuch <hi>Subterranean</hi> Fires
to drink the Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours up; but being moiſt and thick, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcending
<hi>Manna,</hi> inſtead of contracting it ſelf into Globular Bodies, and
through its Weight ſinking to the Earth, dilates it ſelf, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporates
with the floating Vapours: Juſt as if you pour drops of Water, into a
Veſſel full of the ſame Element, thoſe Drops do not ſink to the
Bottom, but finding an Homoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous Body, they mix with it, and are
diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſed every way; whereas, if there be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in the way to ſtop
them, they imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately fall to the Ground.</p>
               <p>But, I ſhall tire thee with my <hi>Philoſophy,</hi>
forgetting that I ſpeak to a Man conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate in all <hi>Sciences.
Adonai</hi> relates many remarkable Paſſages of this Country, too tedious
for a Letter. I will only tell thee in ſhort, That the <hi>Kingdom</hi> of
<hi>Naples,</hi> is eſteemed one of the moſt Delectable <hi>Regions</hi> on
<hi>Earth,</hi> the Trees flouriſhing Twice a Year, and the Soil abounding to
Prodigality with Corn, Wine, Oil and Fruits, and all Things neceſſary for
the Life of Man. Yet, the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants, have this <hi>Proverb</hi> common among
them; <hi>The Kingdom of</hi> Naples <hi>is a Paradiſe of Delights, but it is
inhabited with De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils.</hi> So corrupted are the Manners of the People.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="277" facs="tcp:99492:153"/>Adieu, Dear <hi>Haly,</hi> and think not

ſome Parts of the <hi>Otto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Empire.</hi> Indeed, we have formerly had but
an odd <hi>Idea</hi> of thoſe Remote Countries: But, eſpecially
<hi>China,</hi> has been hid from the greateſt Part of the Earth.</p>
               <p>In my earlier Years, I have heard Men of Gravity, who would be
taken for Knowing Perſons, ſay, That <hi>China</hi> was but a
<hi>Tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Province</hi> of the <hi>Tartars,</hi> a Contemptible Corner of
<hi>Aſia,</hi> and ſo barren, as it could hardly afford Suſtenance for
its Inhabitants; which is a Sign, it is well Peopled. Aſſuredly, our
<hi>Fathers</hi> were Ignorant of this <hi>Country;</hi> which, after the
<hi>Perpetual Monarchy</hi> of the <hi>Oſmans,</hi> may be eſteemed the
<hi>Second Empire</hi> on <hi>Earth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>My Brother ſays, it contains Sixteen <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces,</hi> each
as large as a <hi>Kingdom:</hi> And, that all together, they fill up a Tract of
Ground as big as <hi>Europe;</hi> which, thou knoweſt, is one of the <hi>Four
Quarters</hi> of the <hi>World:</hi> And, that this vaſt Dominion, contains
above a Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Millions of Inhabitants.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Emperour</hi> who Reigned, when <hi>Peſteli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hali</hi>
was there, was called <hi>Zunchin:</hi> A young <hi>Prince,</hi> not above
Thirty Years of Age; in whoſe Veins, ran the <hi>Blood</hi> of Sixteen
<hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours,</hi> his <hi>Progenitors.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the Year 1640. Two great Officers in his Army, having drawn
to their Party an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable <pb n="280" facs="tcp:99492:155"/>Company of the Soldiers,
and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing encouraged by ſome <hi>Grandees</hi> at the <hi>Court,</hi> made a
Revolt. The Names of theſe <hi>Rebels,</hi> were <hi>Lycungz</hi> and
<hi>Changien.</hi> They ſoon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came Maſters of Five <hi>Provinces:</hi>
But, quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relling about their Shares, <hi>Lycungz</hi> cauſed his
Aſſociate to be poiſoned; and taking on himſelf the ſole Command of
the <hi>Rebels,</hi> was proclaimed by them, <hi>Emperour</hi> of
<hi>China.</hi> After which, he marched directly with his whole Forces
againſt <hi>Pequin,</hi> a City where the <hi>Emperour</hi> kept his
<hi>Court:</hi> Knowing, that the Conqueſt of this Place, would ſecure to
him, all the remaining <hi>Provinces</hi> of the <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Chineſe</hi> are reputed a moſt Ingenious People,
excelling in all Manner of <hi>Mecha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nick</hi> Inventions; and the boldeſt
<hi>Architects</hi> in the World. They build Bridges from one Mountain to
another, to ſhorten the Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellers Journey o'er the Plain between them; and,
raiſe Towers almoſt up to the Clouds. Some of their Cities, are ſaid to
be near Thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Leagues in Compaſs, having Double Walls and Ditches. And, my
Brother ſays, the City <hi>Pequin,</hi> wants not much of this Extent: And,
that the <hi>Palace</hi> of the <hi>Emperor,</hi> is near a League in Circuit,
environ'd by Three Walls, and as many Moats; beſides Bulwarks, and other
Fortifications. He adds, That this Mighty <hi>City</hi> and <hi>Palace,</hi> is
guarded by an Hundred Thouſand Soldiers.</p>
               <p>This Impregnable Place, the <hi>Rebels</hi> took by Stratagem,
which was able to have reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted <pb n="281" facs="tcp:99492:155"/>all the Force of
<hi>Aſia. Lycungz</hi> held a private Correſpondence, with ſeveral
<hi>Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dees</hi> within the Town and <hi>Palace.</hi> By whoſe Connivence,
he ſent great Numbers of the Stouteſt Men in his Army, diſguized in the
Habit of <hi>Merchants;</hi> who lodging themſelves in divers Quarters of the
City, on a Day ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, ſuddenly appear'd in Arms; and ſurpriſing the
Guards who defended the Gates, ſlew them all, and opened the Gates to the
<hi>Rebels.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Who can expreſs the Confuſion and Slaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that filled
all Parts of the City with Mourning and Blood? The Barbarous
<hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querour,</hi> ſacrificed all the Loyal and the Brave, to his
Unpardonable Ambition; diſarmed thoſe who eſcaped the firſt
Maſſacre; and having made himſelf Abſolute Maſter of the
<hi>City,</hi> lays a cloſe Siege to the <hi>Imperial Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Emperour</hi> now finding that he was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed, and
that it was too late to defend himſelf from the Cruel Perſecution and
In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult of the Traytors; takes Advantage of the ſhort Reſiſtance, which
ſome of his Faithful Servants made, to conſult his own Honour, with that of
the <hi>Empreſs</hi> and his Daughter. He had above Three Thouſand Wives,
for whom he could not provide in that Flood of Calamities. All his Care being
employed, to prevent the laſt Triumph of his Enemies, in not ſuffering the
<hi>Royal Blood,</hi> to be ſhed by the prophane Hands of thoſe Villains.
He entred into the <hi>Gardens</hi> of the <hi>Palace,</hi> accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied 
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:99492:156"/>onely by his <hi>Empreſs</hi> and Daughter, with Three

great Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of her <hi>Royal</hi> Parents, the Inevitable Ruine of their

               <p>The <hi>Kingdom</hi> of <hi>Naples,</hi> has long groan'd under

               <p>The People were ſenſible of their Calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, yet knew not
how to ſhake off the Yoke. It had gall'd 'em to the Nerves and Sinews; their

which protects the Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, has raiſed up a <hi>Youth</hi> from among

               </p>
               <p>This bold <hi>Youth,</hi> inſpired with a Zeal for the

<hi>Long live the King of</hi> Spain, <hi>but let the Corrupt Officers
periſh.</hi> He had no other Weapon, ſave a <hi>Reed</hi> in his Hand; but
was ſoon followed, by a Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of Boys and Young Men, with Clubs and
Staves, who went along the Streets of that Populous City, repeating the Cry
after him, <hi>Long live the King of</hi> Spain, <hi>but let the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
Officers periſh.</hi> At firſt, the Citizens laugh'd at the Infant Tumult;
but, in leſs than Two Hours, this <hi>Fiſherman</hi> (whoſe Name was
<hi>Maſanello</hi>) had enrolled above Two Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Boys.</p>
               <p>The next Day his Numbers encreaſed, by the Acceſſion of
all Sorts of lewd and idle Perſons, Malecontents, Debtors, and ſuch as were
deſirous of Novelty. Nay, ſome of the better Sort of Citizens, ſhut up
their Shops, took Arms, and mingled with the Popular Inſurrection: So that,
ere Mid-day, there were above Ten Thouſand Men and Boys, marching along the
Streets, and burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Cuſtom-Houſes,</hi> with all their
<hi>Books</hi> of <hi>Accompts,</hi> throughout the City.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Maſanello</hi> beheld himſelf at the Head of ſo

               <q>Rejoice, O ye Faithful People, and ſend up Acclamations to the
<hi>God</hi> of <hi>Heaven,</hi> who hath this Day put it into your Hearts and
Hands, to be your own Redeemers. As for me, my Spirit burned within me, to
ſee the Publick Oppreſſion; and, I ſet no Value on my Life, when I
firſt began this Glorious Enterprize. One of the <hi>Princes</hi> threatned
me with the <hi>Galleys,</hi> if I perſiſted; but, here are Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands my
Witneſſes, That in ſtead of fearing him, I ſmote him on the Breaſt,
and ſent him away joyful, that he eſcaped with his Life. O ye Faithful
People, truſt not the <hi>Princes</hi> or <hi>Nobles:</hi> They are the Men
who Oppreſs you, and would enſlave you. Truſt in your Arms, and the
Juſtice of your Cauſe. <hi>God</hi> has brought you together; let Nothing
ſeparate you, till you have freed your Country, your ſelves, your Wives and
Children, from perpetual Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitude. Chuſe you a <hi>Leader,</hi> a Man of

and ſo I intend to die.</q>
               <p>The People, exceedingly mov'd with this <hi>Speech,</hi> choſe
him with one Accord for their <hi>Leader;</hi> Crying out with loud
Acclamations, <hi>Long live</hi> Maſanello, <hi>the Patron of the</hi>

this confuſed Army, into Regiments and Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies; and ſent forth a
<hi>Proclamation</hi> through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <hi>Naples,</hi> commanding all to take Arms,
on Pain of having their Houſes burnt. So that in a little time, he had above
Fifty Thouſand Armed Men at his Heels.</p>
               <p>Thus accompanied, he marches directly to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the
<hi>Viceroy</hi>'s <hi>Palace,</hi> veſted in <hi>Cloath</hi> of
<hi>Silver,</hi> with a Naked Sword in his Hand. He was accompanied by a
<hi>Cardinal,</hi> who under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took to be a <hi>Mediator,</hi> between the
<hi>Viceroy</hi> and the <hi>People.</hi> His Preſence reſtrain'd the
Multitude, within ſome Bounds of Moderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; for, they Reverenced him, as
the <hi>Father</hi> of the <hi>City.</hi> Yet, they burnt above Sixty
<hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laces</hi> of the <hi>Nobles</hi> to the Ground, with all their
Furniture and Goods; and, it was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Death for any one, to reſcue or
purloin any Thing from the Flames: So rigorouſly <hi>Juſt</hi> was this New
<hi>Lawgiver,</hi> this <hi>Moſes</hi> of the <hi>Neapolitans.</hi> It was in
Vain for the <hi>Vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roy,</hi> to oppoſe Force againſt ſo Formidable an
<hi>Inſurrection.</hi> He entertain'd the Young <hi>Fiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erman,</hi> with
Ceremonies due to a <hi>Prince:</hi> And, having concluded a <hi>Truce,</hi>
gave him the <hi>Title,</hi> of <hi>Chief Tribune</hi> of the <hi>Faithful
People.</hi> This encreaſed the Veneration, the Citizens had already
conceiv'd for <hi>Maſanello:</hi> So that in a Day or Two more, he ſaw
himſelf at the Head, of a Hundred and Fifty Thouſand <pb n="290" facs="tcp:99492:160"/>Armed Men. He gave out all Orders for the <hi>Republick;</hi>
publiſh'd new Edicts; and, all Commiſſions, were iſſued in his Name.
He procured the <hi>Gabels</hi> to be for ever aboliſh'd; reſtor'd the
People to their Ancient Liberty: And, in Fine, was Murdered by his own'
Followers.</p>
               <p>Let me not ſeem an <hi>Advocate</hi> for <hi>Sedition,</hi>
when I tell thee, there was ſomething Brave and <hi>Heroick</hi> in the
Actions of this <hi>Youth.</hi> So ſtrange a <hi>Revolution,</hi> in ſo
ſhort a time, has ſcarce been heard of in the <hi>World.</hi> For a
Beardleſs <hi>Slave,</hi> to raiſe himſelf in Six Days, to as Abſolute
and Uncontroulable a <hi>Sovereign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> as the Greateſt <hi>Monarch</hi>
on Earth enjoys; to be obeyed by an Infinite Number of Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, without the
leaſt Heſitation or Demurr, were it for Life or Death; and all this,
without any Motive of Ambition or Intereſt, but only to aſſert the
Publick Liberty; Is a convincing Argument of his <hi>Vertue,</hi> and ſhews,
That <hi>Heaven</hi> approved his Enterprize. But then again, for him to loſe
all this Power in Four Days more, to be Murd'red in Cold Blood by his own
Party, by the People whoſe Cauſe he had ſo ſucceſsfully vindicated;
this ſhews, the Inſtability of Human Affairs, and, that there is Nothing
Permanent on this Side the <hi>Moon.</hi>

               </head>
               <p>WHEN I clos'd up my Laſt, the Hour of the <hi>Poſt</hi> was
near expir'd; and the Meſſenger who carries my Letters to him, haſtned my
<hi>Diſpatch,</hi> preventing what I had farther to ſay to thee.</p>
               <p>I am ſolicitous for thy Welfare, both as thou art a
<hi>Muſſulman,</hi> and ſo near a <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation.</hi> Do not forfeit
thoſe Titles, by dege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerating from thy <hi>Kindred,</hi> and from all the
<hi>Illuminated</hi> of <hi>God.</hi> Truth is compriz'd in a little Room; but,
Error is Infinite. Thou makeſt a wrong Inference, from the Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration and
Charity of the <hi>True Believers,</hi> when thou concludeſt, That becauſe
they believe, it ſhall go well with all Honeſt Men, let their Opinions and
Ceremonies be what they will; therefore thou ſhalt be ſafe, in retrenching
the Endleſs and Burdenſom <hi>Waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings</hi> (as thou termeſt them) of
the <hi>Muſſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> ſo long as thou leadeſt a Good <hi>Moral</hi>
Life.</p>
               <p>Art thou ſuch a Friend to Idleneſs and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purity, that thou
wilt by a moſt pitiful So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiſtry, cheat thy ſelf of <hi>Salvation,</hi>
rather than take the Pains to waſh thy ſelf after the Manner, and at the
Times appointed by <pb n="292" facs="tcp:99492:161"/>the <hi>Prophet</hi> of <hi>God,</hi>
and practis'd by our <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,</hi> and all the <hi>Faithful</hi>
throughout the <hi>World?</hi> If it be allow'd, that ſuch as either out of
Ignorance, or hindred by ſome other Invincible Cauſe, do not embrace our
<hi>Holy Law,</hi> are not <hi>Circumciſed,</hi> and repair not to the
<hi>Aſſemblies</hi> of the <hi>Faithful,</hi> ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs enter
into <hi>Paradiſe,</hi> provided they obey the <hi>Law</hi> of
<hi>Nature</hi> Imprinted on their Hearts; does it follow therefore, that one
who has been bred up in the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ndefiled Faith,</hi> who has been
<hi>Circumciſed,</hi> and lifting up his Right Hand to <hi>Heaven,</hi> has
pronounc'd the <hi>Seven Myſterious Words,</hi> which cannot be repealed;
does it follow, I ſay, that ſuch an one, ſhall be regarded by
<hi>God</hi> or his <hi>Prophet,</hi> any otherwiſe than as a
<hi>Heretick</hi> or an <hi>Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del,</hi> if he live not up exactly to the
<hi>Graces</hi> that have been given him? No, aſſure thy ſelf, if thou
art in the Number of theſe, thou art an <hi>Apoſtate;</hi> thy Vertues are
Vices, and all thy Good Works are an Abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>Remember the Piety and Magnanimous Zeal of <hi>Aſſan
Hali,</hi> thy <hi>Grandfather;</hi> who, when he was taken Priſoner by the
<hi>Coſſacks,</hi> was entertain'd with extream Rigor and Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity.
Nevertheleſs, a certain <hi>Jew</hi> in the City, who knew him, brought him
every Day, by Permiſſion of the <hi>Keeper,</hi> as much Water as would
ſuffice to waſh him, and to quench his Thirſt. But, one Day, as he went
with his accuſtomed Load, and was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring the Gate of the Priſon; the
<hi>Keeper,</hi> 
                  <pb n="293" facs="tcp:99492:161"/>either out of Malice or Wantonneſs,
ſpilt moſt of the Water on the Ground, forbidding the <hi>Jew</hi> at the
ſame time, to bring any more that Day.</p>
               <p>The honeſt <hi>Hebrew,</hi> went in with the Remainder of the
Water, and deliver'd it to the Priſoner; who, preſently prepared to waſh
himſelf, after the accuſtomed Manner of the <hi>Muſſulmans.</hi> The
<hi>Jew</hi> ſeeing that, told him, There was not Water enough to quench his
Thirſt. And therewith, related to him what the <hi>Keeper</hi> had done.
<hi>I ſee there is but a Little</hi> (reply'd the Vertuous Old Man) <hi>but,
he that Drinks, or Eats, before he has</hi> Waſh'd <hi>himſelf, is guilty
of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filing his</hi> Soul, <hi>and is not worthy to be num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred among the</hi>
True Believers. <hi>Therefore, it is better for me to die for Thirſt, than
vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late the</hi> Law <hi>brought down from</hi> Heaven, <hi>and tranſgreſs
the</hi> Traditions <hi>of my</hi> Fathers. Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſaid this, he
<hi>Waſh'd</hi> himſelf, being Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd to <hi>Providence.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Couſin,</hi> deceive not thy ſelf with vain O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions,
nor ſuffer <hi>Hypocrites</hi> to ſeduce thee. Imitate the <hi>Adder,</hi>
and ſhut thy Ears againſt the Crafty Inſinuations of <hi>Hereticks.</hi>
It is reported of this little <hi>Serpent,</hi> That by <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural</hi>
Inſtinct, being ſenſible when a <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gician</hi> is about to utter
Words which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing heard will enſnare it, lays one Ear cloſe to the Ground,
and with its Tail ſtops the other, to the End the <hi>Enchantment</hi> may
have no Effect.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="294" facs="tcp:99492:162"/>Admit not any Man to thy Converſation,
who ſhall attempt to warp thee from the Simplicity of the <hi>Faith</hi> and
<hi>Obedience,</hi> which thou oweſt to the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> of
<hi>God.</hi> Without <hi>Water,</hi> there is no <hi>Purity</hi> on this Side
the Grave. That <hi>Element,</hi> has a Force in it, of which thou art not
aware. 'Tis the Third, in the Rank of Living Principles. 'Tis the
<hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle</hi> of the Winds; The <hi>Seraglio</hi> of the Generative
Spirit; The Stage of Wonders. In fine, it is the Purifier of every Thing that
has Breath.</p>
               <p>Thou knoweſt, that to ſerve the Neceſſities of the
<hi>Prophet</hi> and his Army, <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding</hi> and <hi>Speech</hi>
was given to a <hi>Fountain</hi> in <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bia;</hi> which having promiſed
to follow him to the Place of his Repoſe, made a Channel through the
<hi>Deſart,</hi> and kept Pace with the Troops of the <hi>Faithful,</hi> till
they came to <hi>Medina Talnabi:</hi> That ſo, the <hi>Submiſſive</hi> to
the <hi>Will</hi> of <hi>Heaven,</hi> might not want that <hi>Element,</hi>
without which, Life it ſelf would be a Burden and a Curſe.</p>
               <p>And yet, thou ſpeakeſt contemptibly of <hi>Water,</hi> as a
very Indifferent Thing, whether we uſe it or not, any other ways than to
quench our Thirſt. Thus, making no Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, between the many Advantages
we reap from that <hi>Element,</hi> and that Common Uſe, to which the
Beaſts put it. In how many Places of the <hi>Alcoran,</hi> does the <hi>Holy
Prophet</hi> record the <hi>Mercy</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> in giving us Water that
is Freſh and not Salt? How does he ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrate his Wiſdom and Goodneſs,
for di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting <pb n="295" facs="tcp:99492:162"/>the Clouds to barren and dry Places? Thou
canſt not be Ignorant, that it is one of the <hi>Encomiums</hi> of
<hi>Paradiſe,</hi> that there are Gardens wherein flow many Rivers. And after
all this, wilt thou diſpiſe ſo Holy and Bleſſed a Gift, without
which, Earth and Heaven, Men and Angels, could not be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletely happy?</p>
               <p>Go learn then of the <hi>Indian Idolaters,</hi> who have never
heard of the <hi>Book</hi> of <hi>Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry:</hi> Go learn of theſe
<hi>Barbarians,</hi> to prize this <hi>Sanctify'd</hi> Creature. They travel
many Hundreds of Leagues, to bathe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in the Waters of
<hi>Ganges.</hi> With thoſe Incorruptible and All-purging Streams, the
<hi>Brachmans</hi> fill certain Veſſels, and tranſport the Invaluable
Liquor, to the Utmoſt Parts of that Wide <hi>Empire.</hi> They travel on
Foot, ſometimes Two Thouſand Miles together, each Man with his Load of that
precious Water, to ſupply the Wants of thoſe, who live ſo remote from the
River. So that a Bottle of it, is many times ſold to the <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi>
and <hi>Nobles,</hi> for Two Hundred <hi>Sequins,</hi> or Eight Hundred
<hi>Roupies:</hi> And yet, for all this, thoſe very <hi>Princes,</hi> would
not die with a ſafe Conſcience, had they not at leaſt once in their Lives
made a <hi>Pilgrimage,</hi> to this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned River, and bath'd themſelves in
the <hi>Waves</hi> which blot out <hi>Sins.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>O <hi>Couſin,</hi> let the Example of theſe
<hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidels,</hi> make thee bluſh at thy Impiety, and excite thee, to a
diligent and indiſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Practice of <hi>Cleanneſs.</hi> So ſhalt
thou <pb n="296" facs="tcp:99492:163"/>have a Sound Mind, in a Healthy Body. And, the

               </head>
               <p>THE Defeat of the <hi>Venetians</hi> and <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacks</hi> in
<hi>Boſna,</hi> has reached theſe Parts. That News, is not unwelcom to
<hi>Mahmut.</hi> But, I could wiſh, our <hi>General</hi> had uſed his
Victory with more Moderation. The <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians</hi> term him
<hi>Barbarian, Salvage, Devil Incarnate;</hi> and, load him with Execrations.
For, having taken Priſoner the <hi>Captain</hi> of the <hi>Morlacks,</hi> he
cauſed him to be flead a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live, and afterwards to be Impal'd. This
<hi>Captain,</hi> was an <hi>Eccleſiaſtick:</hi> They call him,
<hi>Stephano Sorich;</hi> and, in Honour of his Zeal and Fidelity, they entitle
him, <hi>the Good Prieſt.</hi> They applaud his Magnanimity and Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage in
Battel; and, no leſs do they extoll his Conſtancy, during the Torments of
ſo Cruel and Ignominious a Death. But, I trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to think of the
Blaſphemies and Curſes, they utter againſt our <hi>Holy Prophet,</hi> and
all the <hi>Muſſulmans!</hi> For, this Cruel Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, 
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:99492:163"/>has ſcandaliz'd the <hi>Nazarenes,</hi> and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitter'd
'em even to Fury. Their Revenge is implacable: They would go to <hi>Hell</hi>
them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, provided the <hi>True Faithful</hi> might be <hi>Damn'd</hi> for
<hi>Company!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What will our <hi>Divine Lawgiver</hi> ſay? Or, what Apology
will our <hi>General</hi> make, when the <hi>Sent</hi> of <hi>God</hi> ſhall
charge him, with dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſo many Thouſand Souls, into an Irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concilable
Hatred of the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ndefiled Faith?</hi> For, they look not on this, as the
Action of a <hi>Private</hi> Man, but of one who repreſents the
<hi>Perſon</hi> of our <hi>Auguſt Sovereign,</hi> the Great
<hi>Protector</hi> of the <hi>Law</hi> brought down from <hi>Heaven.</hi> They
ſuppoſe him, to be honour'd with the particular Inſtructions of his
<hi>Maſter.</hi> And therefore, they ſay, the <hi>Sultan</hi> has
authoriz'd this Unheard-of Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty; and, that our <hi>Religion</hi>
countenances Tyranny, and the moſt Nefandous Methods, of ſhedding Innocent
Blood.</p>
               <p>I am no Advocate for <hi>Infidels;</hi> yet, ſuffer me to
vindicate <hi>Nature,</hi> which is the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Parent</hi> of us all.
Suffer me to be So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitous, for the Honour of our <hi>Holy
Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,</hi> which is blemiſh'd by this Inhumane Murder. What
Offence had this Unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py <hi>Captain</hi> given, that deſerv'd ſo dire a
Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment? Was it, becauſe he fought vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>antly, and perform'd Wonders in
Defence of his Country? This is Nothing, but what becomes every Honeſt Man to
do. And, had our <hi>General</hi> been truly Brave, he would have entertain'd
his Priſoner, with a Reſpect due to his Merit.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="298" facs="tcp:99492:164"/>Who was a more Inveterate Enemy of the
<hi>Muſſulmans,</hi> than the Renowned <hi>Iſchen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derbeg, Prince</hi> of
<hi>Albania?</hi> Who more Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant or Succeſsful, againſt the
<hi>Ottoman</hi> Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies? It is Recorded of him, That he never ſhun'd a
Battel, never fled from his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, never ſhrunk from Perils, nor was ever
wounded but once, in all his Life. And yet, he ſuſtain'd a Continual War,
from Two Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive <hi>Oſman Emperors;</hi> defeated Seven
<hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zirs,</hi> with their Forces; took all their Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munition and Baggage;
and, in ſeveral Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bats, ſlew with his own Hands, above Two Thouſand
<hi>Mahometans.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Our <hi>Fathers</hi> did not baſely revenge them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves for
all this, but cheriſh'd a Veneration for this <hi>Heroick</hi> Enemy, and
honour'd the very <hi>Duſt</hi> of ſuch an extraordinary Perſon. For,
after his Death, having conquer'd <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bania,</hi> they ſought out his
<hi>Tomb;</hi> where they performed their <hi>Devotions,</hi> as at the
<hi>Sepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher</hi> of a <hi>Prophet.</hi> They open'd the <hi>Dormi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory</hi>
of the Deſunct <hi>Warriour;</hi> and, with <hi>Religious Solemnity,</hi>
took up his <hi>Bones,</hi> ſhar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Honour'd <hi>Reliques</hi> among
them; and, wrapping them up in Silk, wore them continually at their Breaſts,
eſteeming them as <hi>Sacred Amulets</hi> againſt <hi>Misfortune.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Surely, our <hi>General</hi> would bluſh, at an Example of
ſo great Vertue. But, perhaps he was incenſed, becauſe his
<hi>Captive</hi> was a <hi>Prieſt:</hi> Miſtaken Zeal, might prompt him to
this horrid Butchery. Thou, who art <hi>Juſtice</hi> it ſelf, wilt not
approve his Bloody <pb n="299" facs="tcp:99492:164"/>Paſſion, when thou
conſidereſt, That the <hi>Prieſts</hi> of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> are Men, as
well as others; and, if they live in Error, the Fault is in their Education.
However, many of them, are Humble, Chaſt, Sober, and Lovers of Vertue. If
there be others, whoſe Corrupt Lives have contradicted this Character, let
the Crime and the Puniſhment, reſt on their Heads. It is not Reaſonable,
that the Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent ſhould ſuffer, for the Faults of the Guilty. The
<hi>Captain</hi> of the <hi>Morlacks,</hi> had the Reputation, of a Devout and
Juſt Man, and a Stout Champion for his Country. Had he been taken for a
<hi>Spy,</hi> or an <hi>Aſſaſſin,</hi> the <hi>Law</hi> of
<hi>Arms</hi> would have adjudg'd him to Death. Yet, ſuch was the Clemency of
<hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenna, King</hi> of the <hi>Hetrurians,</hi> that when <hi>Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius
Scaevola,</hi> a Valiant <hi>Roman,</hi> came into his Camp, with Deſign to
Murder him, but by Miſtake ſtabb'd one of the <hi>Captains,</hi> thinking
it had been <hi>Porſenna;</hi> and, to revenge that Miſcarriage on
himſelf, thruſt his Hand into the Fire, till the Fleſh was conſum'd to
the Bones; the <hi>King</hi> aſtoniſh'd at his Undaunted Spirit, ſent him
away in Peace, raiſed the Siege of <hi>Rome,</hi> and entred into a ſtrict
Friendſhip with that <hi>Nation.</hi> Such Honour he bore, to the Fortitude
of his Enemy, and deſigned-Murderer. But, the <hi>Captain</hi> of the
<hi>Morlacks,</hi> was not taken under theſe Circumſtances: He loſt his
Liberty in the Heat of Battel, bravely combating at the Head of his Army.</p>
               <p>Wouldſt thou know the Grounds then of our <hi>General</hi>'s
Cruelty? It was purely for the <pb n="300" facs="tcp:99492:165"/>Sake of a <hi>Jeſt.</hi>
There went a Report, That when this <hi>Prieſt</hi> was born, his Body was
all over raw; ſo that the <hi>Phyſicians,</hi> were forc'd by Art, to
ſupply him with a Skin. Our Cruel <hi>General,</hi> to ſport himſelf in
the Poor Man's Miſery, commanded him to be flea'd alive; uttering at the
ſame Time, this Inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane <hi>Sarcaſm; There was no Reaſon, that he
ſhould carry a Skin out of the World, who brought none in.</hi> This is
atteſted by Two Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, who were made Priſoners with their
<hi>Captain,</hi> heard theſe Words, ſaw him Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted, and afterwards made
their Eſcape.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Nazarenes</hi> vow, to Revenge this Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paralell'd
Cruelty, on all the <hi>Muſſulmans</hi> that fall into their Hands, if this
<hi>Butcher</hi> (as they term him) be ſuffer'd to go Unpuniſh'd. I tell
thee, ſuch Barbarous Actions, draw down the <hi>Vengeance</hi> of
<hi>Heaven,</hi> on thoſe that commit them and, excite the very
<hi>Beaſts</hi> of the <hi>Earth</hi> to make <hi>War,</hi> and rid the
<hi>World</hi> of ſuch <hi>Monſters.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thou knoweſt, what uſe to make of this Intelligence. I will
not pretend to Inſtruct the <hi>Second Miniſter</hi> in the <hi>Ottoman
Empire.</hi>

               <p>The Fortune of that <hi>Kingdom,</hi> has for a long time run

<hi>Perſia,</hi> and the Defection of <hi>Goa,</hi> with other Rich Towns of
Traffick in the <hi>Indies,</hi> came one upon the Back of another.</p>
               <p>Since which, there have been many Towns and Caſtles taken from
the <hi>Spaniards</hi> in <hi>Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.</hi> The <hi>French</hi> made an
<hi>Inſurrection</hi> in <hi>Palermo,</hi> breaking open the Priſons, and
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſing the Priſoners: And grew to ſuch a Head, that the
<hi>Viceroy,</hi> fearing they would revenge the <hi>Tragedy</hi> of the

<hi>Edicts</hi> for <hi>Taxes,</hi> and diſannul them for ever, and to paſs

               <p>This Tumultuous Spirit, paſs'd from thence to the

who being profeſſed Enemies to the <hi>Meſſenger</hi> of <hi>God,</hi>
have no other Right to any Thing, but what their Swords purchaſe. And
there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, when they prey upon others, and by Rapine and Spoil augment their
Riches, it is no Wonder, if the <hi>Great Avenger</hi> of <hi>Crimes,</hi>
ſtirs up ſome undaunted Spirits, to free their Country from Slavery and
Ruine.</p>
               <p>Thoſe who are curious, have remark'd ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Obſervable
Circumſtances in this <hi>Revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> at <hi>Naples;</hi> as, that it
was foretold by an <pb n="303" facs="tcp:99492:166"/>
                  <hi>Aſtrologer,</hi> a
conſiderable Time before it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd, who pointed out the very Year wherein
it ſhould come to paſs. The Extraordinary Eruptions alſo of <hi>Mount
Veſuvius</hi> ſome Years ago, were eſteem'd as Preſages of ſome
ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching Troubles in the <hi>State:</hi> For, it rain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Aſhes on the
City of <hi>Naples.</hi> I ſpoke of this Mountain, in one of my former
Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</p>
               <p>'Tis reported alſo, That about the ſame Hour, wherein
<hi>Maſanello,</hi> the <hi>Ringleader</hi> of the <hi>Seditious</hi> was
Murd'red, there was ſeen a <hi>Man</hi> hovering in the Air, over the
Principal <hi>Temple</hi> of <hi>Naples,</hi> with a Sword in his Hand, which
he was putting up in his Scabberd: And, that a Voice was at the ſame time
heard from on High, to utter theſe Words, <hi>His La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour is finiſh'd, give
him Reſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is certain, that whilſt he was at the Head of an Hundred
Thouſand Men, Seven <hi>Aſſaſſines</hi> were hired by ſome of the
<hi>Princes</hi> to ſhoot him; yet, none of the Bullets could penetrate his
Body, though Unarm'd, and only covered with his Fiſhing Rags: And, it was
evident, that theſe Bullets ſmote him in divers Places; his Garments being
marked with them, and he ſtagger'd with the Force of the Blows.</p>
               <p>Theſe are Extraordinary Occurrences, and would tempt one to
believe, That this Young <hi>Fiſherman</hi> was the Inſtrument of
<hi>Providence,</hi> and that <hi>Heaven</hi> protected both <hi>Him</hi> and
his <hi>Cauſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>'Tis true indeed, it ſeem'd at laſt, as if he 
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:99492:167"/>were abandon'd by that <hi>Divine Power,</hi> which had
carried him through ſo Important an En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprize, in that he was Slain by his
own Soldiers. But, then it muſt be remembred, that this was not done, till
his <hi>Work</hi> was <hi>finiſhed,</hi> and he went beyond his
<hi>Commiſſion.</hi> Want of Sleep, the Multitude of Affairs, and much
Wine, had impaired his Reaſon, and rendred him Frantick; ſo that, his
Actions were Inſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portable, and his own Admirers grew weary of him. After
his Death, his Head was cut off, and carried up and down the Streets on a
Lance; and his Body was dragged through the Kennels. Yet, the very next Day,
the Multitude, to ſhew their own Fickleneſs, took the Dead Body out of a
Ditch, where they had laid it all Night: They Waſhed and Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>balmed it; and,
having join'd the Head to it, carried it with great Pomp and Solemnity to the
Principal <hi>Temple</hi> of <hi>Naples,</hi> attended with Drums and Trumpets,
and above a Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand <hi>Prieſts,</hi> with Torches in their Hands. A
Crown of Gold was put on his Head, and a Scepter in his Hand.</p>
               <p>Thus the <hi>Neapolitans</hi> honoured that Beard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
<hi>Youth,</hi> who in 'Ten Days time, had cauſed ſuch a
<hi>Revolution,</hi> as is ſcarce to be paralell'd. For, he was an Abſolute
<hi>Monarch,</hi> in Effect, during that time. And of him it may be ſaid, as
it was once of an <hi>Emperor,</hi> That during his whole <hi>Reign,</hi> there
was neither <hi>Spring,</hi> nor <hi>Autumn,</hi> nor <hi>Winter:</hi> For, his
<hi>Royalty</hi> begun and ended, in the Seventh <hi>Moon.</hi>

               <p>
                  <pb n="305" facs="tcp:99492:167"/>By Letters from <hi>Nathan Ben Saddi,</hi>
at <hi>Vienna,</hi> I perceive he is moleſted with Scruples about his

ſent him the beſt Advice I could, without making my ſelf a

to furniſh him with <hi>Books</hi> of our <hi>Law,</hi> and the

News, whilſt I mourn for the Diſhonour of Our Arms. Nothing but ſad
Tydings grate my Ears from thoſe Parts, and more melancholy Preſages
poſſeſs my Soul. Methinks, I ſee thick Clouds gathering o'er the
<hi>Imperial</hi> City: My Sleep is diſturb'd with fearful
<hi>Viſions.</hi> I ſtart in my Bed, and waking lay my Hand on my Sword, as
if ſome Danger were at Hand. I dream of Tumults and Diſorders, neighing of
Horſes, and claſhing of Arms in the Streets of <hi>Conſtantinople.</hi> I
pray <hi>God</hi> avert the <hi>Omen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is reported here, That <hi>Ali,</hi> the <hi>Sangiac-Bey</hi>
of <hi>Lippa,</hi> is taken Priſoner, and that his Son was tormented to Death
before his Face, in a Manner peculiar to the Invention of the moſt Barbarous
Tyrants: For, they cauſed ſharp Thorns, to be thruſt between his Nails
and his Fleſh; which creates an intolerable Anguiſh. They laid him on a Bed
of Iron-Spikes, <pb n="307" facs="tcp:99492:168"/>and poured Melted Lead, Drop by Drop, on
all Parts of his Fleſh. Then they made a ſmall Fire, and roaſted him
ſlowly to Death. If he chanced to groan, or make the leaſt Complaint, in
the Midſt of thoſe grievous Tortures, they bid him remember the Good
<hi>Prieſt Sorich,</hi> who ſet him an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of Conſtancy and Courage;
in that he never ſhed a Tear, or ſo much as ſigh'd, when he was
<hi>Flea'd alive.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thou ſeeſt, that Revenge is ſweet, even to thoſe, who
having receiv'd no Injury in their own Perſons, yet are touched to the Quick,
with the Violence that is done to another. This will appear in the Humour of
the <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians,</hi> who proſecute their Enemies, with ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reconcilable
Hatred and Malice; whole <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies</hi> being often engag'd, in executing
the Reſentments of Two ſingle Perſons, who firſt began the Quarrel:
But, much more forcible is this Paſſion in thoſe, who have been
noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly hurt themſelves. And, the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge of a certain
<hi>Captain</hi> was Extravagant; who being informed, that his <hi>General</hi>
had Debauch'd his Wife, took an Opportunity to ſingle him out from all other
Company, pretending to walk in the Fields. When he had him there alone, he
clapt a Piſtol to his Breaſt, threatning to kill him forthwith, if he moved
Hand or Foot. Then he up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braided him with what he had done, in ſuch Language,
as convinced the <hi>General,</hi> his Life was in extreme Danger. Wherefore,
he humbled himſelf, and confeſſed his Crime; <pb n="908" facs="tcp:99492:169"/>begging of the <hi>Captain,</hi> to ſpare his Life, and he would
preferr him forthwith, to the beſt Office in the Army next his own. But, the
furious <hi>Italian,</hi> would not ſell his <hi>Honour</hi> ſo Cheap. He
forced him to deny <hi>God,</hi> and utter many <hi>Blaſphemies,</hi> in
Hopes of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving his Life: And, when he had thus done, the <hi>Captain</hi>
ſaid, <hi>Now my Revenge is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete, ſince I ſhall ſend thee Body and

               <p>But, leaving theſe <hi>Infidels</hi> to their

               <p>THou wilt ſay, the <hi>Neapolitans</hi> are a reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
People, when thou ſhalt know, That there have been no leſs than Forty
General <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrections</hi> 
                  <pb n="309" facs="tcp:99492:169"/>in this
<hi>Kingdom,</hi> ſince its firſt Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration from the <hi>Grecian
Empire,</hi> whereof it was formerly a Member; and, that in the Space of Two
Years, they have had Five <hi>Kings,</hi> all of different
<hi>Nations.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>One would have thought, That after the Death of
<hi>Maſanello,</hi> the <hi>Ringleader</hi> of the late <hi>Innovation,</hi>
the Popular Heats would have ſlacken'd, and the People returned to their
Duty; but, the paſſionate Deſire of Liberty, caus'd them to continue in
Arms, till the Confirmation of their Privileges, ſhould come from the King of
<hi>Spain.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the mean Time, <hi>Don John</hi> of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> who
lay before the City with a Fleet of Fifty <hi>Gallions,</hi> play'd upon them
inceſſantly with his Cannon by Sea; and, the Caſtles batter'd them by
Land.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Cardinal Mazarini,</hi> who has the earlieſt Intelligence
of Foreign Tranſactions, has had a Principal Hand in fomenting this Flame.
For, as ſoon as the News of <hi>Maſanello</hi>'s Death arriv'd here, he
diſpatch'd away <hi>Couriers</hi> to <hi>Rome,</hi> with Inſtructions to
the <hi>French Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador</hi> at that <hi>Court,</hi> requiring him, to
uſe all poſſible Means, to cheriſh the <hi>Tumults</hi> in
<hi>Naples,</hi> and not neglect ſo fair an Opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, of reducing that
<hi>Kingdom</hi> under the <hi>Protection</hi> of <hi>France.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It will not appear ſtrange, That this great <hi>Genius,</hi>
ſhould aim at the Conqueſt of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,</hi> when we conſider, That
this <hi>Kingdom</hi> abounds in all Manner of Riches, to which its fortunate
Situation contributes not a Little: <pb n="310" facs="tcp:99492:170"/>For, it lies in the
moſt Temperate Part of the World. And, the Inhabitants, are not
<hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond</hi> to any People of <hi>Europe,</hi> in <hi>Martial</hi> Courage
and Bravery. This is a Bait, which tempts the <hi>Cardinal;</hi> who is not
ignorant, how valiantly the Anceſtors of the preſent <hi>Neapolitans,</hi>
behav'd themſelves in the <hi>Wars</hi> of <hi>Caeſar</hi> and
<hi>Pompey,</hi> and thoſe between the <hi>Romans</hi> and
<hi>Carthaginians.</hi> Nor are they leſs Celebrated, for the ſtout
Reſiſtance they made againſt the <hi>Huns, Goths</hi> and
<hi>Vandals.</hi> So that, this <hi>Kingdom,</hi> were it once brought under
the <hi>French</hi> Dominion, would prove a <hi>Nurſery,</hi> from whence
this <hi>Monarch</hi> might draw many Thouſands of excellent Soldiers, to
ſerve him in his Wars.</p>
               <p>Beſides, it would be more commodious for him, to make
Incurſions from hence into the <hi>Pope</hi>'s Territories, if there ſhould
ariſe any Difference between the Two <hi>Courts;</hi> as there often do,
about the Rights of the <hi>Gallican Church,</hi> the <hi>Franchiſes</hi> of
the <hi>Embaſſadors</hi> of this <hi>Crown</hi> in <hi>Rome,</hi> and other
Privileges to which they pretend.</p>
               <p>Therefore the <hi>French Embaſſador,</hi> accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the
Inſtructions of <hi>Mazarini,</hi> ſent <hi>Commiſſioners</hi> to treat
privately with the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>Naples,</hi> offering them Two Millions of
Crowns, Twenty Gallions, with Eight and Fifty Gallies, and other Veſſels.
They accepted the Propoſal, being weary of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Government,
and deſirous of Novel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, Encourag'd alſo by what thoſe
<hi>Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners</hi> repreſented to them, concerning the 
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:99492:170"/>Succeſs of the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> who by ſtanding on
their Guard, and uſing that Power which <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Nature</hi> had
given them, for the Defence of their Lives and Liberties, were now in a Manner
become a <hi>Free People,</hi> having Aboliſh'd the <hi>Monarchy,</hi> and
ſet up a <hi>Commonwealth:</hi> And this, they told them, was alſo done by
<hi>Cardinal Mazarini</hi>'s Counſels and Aſſiſtance. Now, all the Cry
in <hi>Naples</hi> was, <hi>Let</hi> France <hi>and the</hi> People <hi>of</hi>
England <hi>flouriſh, and let the</hi> Faithful Neapolitans, <hi>aſſert
their own</hi> Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty. So blind were theſe People, as not to conſider.
That in putting themſelves under the Protection of the <hi>French,</hi> they
did but ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change One Bondage for Another; it being im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible, for any
foreign <hi>Prince,</hi> to keep this <hi>Kingdom,</hi> and pay all his
Officers Civil and Military, together with thoſe under their Commands, with
much leſs Charge than the Revenues amount to. And, the <hi>French</hi> are as
good at inventing new <hi>Taxes,</hi> as any <hi>Court</hi> in
<hi>Europe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>However, the <hi>Neapolitans</hi> were enchanted with the
Thoughts of ſo much Gold, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Aſſiſtance offer'd by the
<hi>French Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners;</hi> and ſweeten'd, with their fair Words, and
glorious Promiſes. So that they imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately ſent <hi>Deputies,</hi> to
entreat the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Guize,</hi> who was then at <hi>Rome,</hi> to
come and protect them, in taking on him the Chief Command of their Arms.</p>
               <p>This <hi>Prince,</hi> thinking it a Generous Action to relieve
the <hi>Oppreſſed:</hi> And, that at the ſame Time, he ſhould do a
conſiderable Service to <pb n="312" facs="tcp:99492:171"/>the King of <hi>France,</hi> in
rendring him <hi>Maſter</hi> of this Noble and Opulent <hi>Kingdom;</hi> went
to <hi>Naples.</hi> Where, at firſt, he was receiv'd with Infinite
Applauſe; was made their <hi>General;</hi> took an Oath of <hi>Fidelity</hi>
to the <hi>People;</hi> did ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Notable Services; but was, in the End,
be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray'd, and ſent Priſoner to <hi>Spain.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If the Generoſity and brave Reſolution of this
<hi>Prince,</hi> has acquired Commendation from ſome, in attempting to
reſcue theſe People from the Tyranny of their Governours: Yet, his Conduct
is call'd in Queſtion by others, who ſay, He diſcover'd but little
Prudence in truſting himſelf to the <hi>Neapolitans,</hi> who had already
ſacrific'd Two of their <hi>Generals.</hi> (For, after the Death of
<hi>Maſanello,</hi> they choſe another Captain, whom they call'd the
<hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Maſſa:</hi> This <hi>Prince</hi> falling under their
Suſpicion, was beheaded by the <hi>Inconſtant</hi> People.)</p>
               <p>'Tis certain, that there is little Confidence to be put in the
<hi>Multitude,</hi> whoſe Paſſions Ebb and Flow, and are more
Tempeſtuous than the Sea. Yet, a Brave and Generous Mind, will ſhun no
Dangers, to ſerve his <hi>Prince</hi> and his <hi>Country;</hi> for whom, it
is a Glorious <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrdom</hi> to die. There is no great Undertaking without
Hazards, and, he that is afraid to venture his Liberty and Life, in a Good
Cauſe, is not worthy to bear Arms. Had the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Guize</hi>
ſucceeded, his Conqueſt of <hi>Naples</hi> had made him <hi>Viceroy</hi> of
one of the largeſt <hi>Kingdoms</hi> in <hi>Europe.</hi> It is ſaid to be
Five Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Leagues in Circuit, containing Twelve <pb n="313" facs="tcp:99492:171"/>ample
<hi>Provinces,</hi> Twenty Archbiſhopricks, Biſhopricks One Hundred Twenty
Seven: Thirty Caſtles: Barons One Thouſand Four Hundred. Earls Fifty Three.
Forty Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſes. Thirty Four Dukes, and Twenty Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. The Inhabitants of
this Kingdom, are ſaid to be above Two Millions. The ordinary Revenues of the
King, amount to Three Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions of Crowns yearly, beſides the Voluntary
Donatives, which have been given by the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of this <hi>State</hi> to
their Kings, within the Space of Forty Years, amounting to Twenty Eight
Millions, and Six Hundred Thouſand Duckats. This <hi>Kingdom,</hi> is water'd
by a Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and Fifty Rivers, beſides Ten Lakes ſtor'd with all Manner of
Fiſh; among which, is one called <hi>Averno,</hi> over which if any Birds
flie, they immediately drop down dead. The An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient <hi>Pagans,</hi> had
ſtrange Opinions of this <hi>Lake;</hi> it being the Place, where they uſed
to Sacrifice Men to the <hi>Infernal Gods.</hi> And, hard by, is the
<hi>Cave</hi> of one of the <hi>Sybills.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There are Thirty high Mountains in this Country, of which
<hi>Adonai</hi> relates many ſtrange and delightful Paſſages, (for, 'tis
from him I receiv'd this Account of the <hi>Kingdom.</hi>) I will not trouble
thee, with a Repetition of all that this <hi>Jew</hi> tells me; onely one Thing
is worthy Remark.</p>
               <p>He ſays, That the Bodies of the Three Young <hi>Hebrews,</hi>
who were put into the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Oven by the <hi>Babylonian Monarch,</hi>
be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they would not adore his <hi>Idols,</hi> are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd in a
<hi>Moſque</hi> on one of theſe Mountains. <pb n="314" facs="tcp:99492:172"/>And, that
on the ſaid Hill, no Eggs, Fleſh or Milk, will endure an Hour without
Putrefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, but preſently breed an Infinite Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Worms. He ſpeaks
in the Praiſe of theſe Mountains, which are cloath'd with Vineyards,
Gardens and Woods on the Top and Sides; and in their Bottoms, have very Rich
Mines of Gold, Silver, Copper, Iron, Cryſtal, Alabaſter, Adamant. In fine,
<hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donai,</hi> who has travelled over all this <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi> calls it,
The fertileſt <hi>Region</hi> of all <hi>Italy,</hi> which is eſteem'd, the
<hi>Paradiſe</hi> of <hi>Europe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Doſt thou not think now, <hi>Venerable Guide</hi> of the
<hi>Elect,</hi> that the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Guize</hi> had Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to

<hi>Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant</hi> to the <hi>Sent</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> are extant in the
<hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabick Tongue.</hi> In them it is written, <hi>My Soul on a ſudden,
became as though it had Wings; a Spirit enter'd me, and a ſubtle Wind lifted
me up to the Top of</hi> Mount Uriel, <hi>where I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held Marvellous Things. I
looked behind me, and ſaw the</hi> Ages <hi>that were paſt; and loe, they
were without Number, or Beginning.</hi> I beheld the <hi>Four</hi> Seaſons
<hi>of the Year, ever re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning at their accuſtomed Time, and the Sun
forſook not his Courſe, for a Thouſand Thouſand Generations. I counted
a Million of Ages, and yet there appear'd not an Hour, wherein Darkneſs had
poſſeſſed the Abyſs of Matter, or wherein the Endleſs Firmament was
not Illuminated by the</hi> Moon <hi>and</hi> Stars. <hi>Whilſt I
conſidered theſe Things, a Liquor was given me to drink by an <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nknown
Hand, it was of the Colour of</hi> Amber: <hi>When I had taſted it, I felt a
marvellous Force in my Body, and my Eyes were more piercing than an</hi>
Eagles. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother Wind, more powerful than the former, blew out of a Cloud,
and carried me up to an exceeding High Place, for above the talleſt
Mountains; There I trod in the ſoft Air, as on a Pavement of Marble. I was
raviſh'd at theſe Things; and the Exaltation of my State, made me forget my
Mortality. I beheld the Earth at a vaſt Diſtance under my Feet, as one that
did not belong to it; it look'd like a ſhining Globe, not much unlike
the</hi> Moon, <hi>but far <pb n="317" facs="tcp:99492:173"/>bigger. All the</hi> Living
Generations, <hi>which had ſucceſſively Inhabited the Earth from its
Nativity, paſs'd by me; and they appear'd in various Forms. Firſt came a
Race of</hi> Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taurs, <hi>then of</hi> Satyrs, <hi>next of</hi> Angels,
<hi>and laſt of</hi> Men. <hi>While I marvelled at theſe Things, a Voice
reach'd my Ears, as from behind me, ſaying, Theſe are the</hi> Four Ages
<hi>of the</hi> World, <hi>and the</hi> Four Species <hi>of</hi> Beings, <hi>to
whom I gave the Poſſeſſion of the</hi> Earth; <hi>but, for the Impiety
of the Three former, I have exterminated them. And, when Men ſhall have
completed the Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of their Sins, I will cauſe the</hi> Trumpet <hi>to
ſound, and all Things ſhall retire into the</hi> Cave <hi>of</hi> Silence
<hi>and</hi> Darkneſs. <hi>Having heard this, I found my ſelf in a moment
on the</hi> Earth, <hi>which I had before ſeen afar off; then I knew that I
had been in a</hi> Trance, &amp;c.</p>

That theſe Things were not always ſo. That Thought, would damp my

ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Splendors, Riches and Pleaſures, as this <hi>Viſible Frame</hi>
affords, were not diſclos'd for Millions of Ages, but lay hid in the Boſom
of <hi>Eternity.</hi> Methinks, it is too low an O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion of the <hi>Omnipotent
Goodneſs,</hi> and looks, as if the Authors of it, ſuſpected <hi>God</hi>
of <hi>Envy:</hi> Who, when he might have made Infinite <hi>Myriads</hi> of
Creatures happy, in theſe Viſible Emanations of his <hi>Divinity,</hi>
without either Beginning or Ending of Time; yet, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their

taſte of his Munificence, for a few <hi>Centuries</hi> of Years. This is not

Great <hi>Light</hi> of <hi>Aſrick,</hi> Is it repugnant to <hi>Reaſon</hi>
or <hi>Faith,</hi> to believe, That the <hi>Earth</hi> has been
<hi>Inhabited</hi> from <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity;</hi> ſince our <hi>Holy Doctors</hi>
teach us, That it was peopl'd long before the <hi>Creation</hi> of
<hi>Adam?</hi> No <hi>Muſſulman,</hi> that has ever gone the <hi>Sacred
Pilgrimage,</hi> but has viſited <hi>Mount Araffa,</hi> where <hi>Adam</hi>
firſt ſaw <hi>Eve</hi> his Wife. There he has been inſtructed, in the
<hi>Hiſtory</hi> of that <hi>Firſt Father</hi> of <hi>Mankind;</hi> and how
that before his Time, the <hi>Earth</hi> was Inhabited by <hi>Angels,</hi> who
being commanded to adore <hi>Adam,</hi> refus'd it, and were turn'd to
<hi>Devils,</hi> being expell'd from the <hi>Earth.</hi> Thou know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt 
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:99492:174"/>moreover, that it is in the <hi>Sacred Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi>
That <hi>God</hi> gave to <hi>Adam</hi> a Wife whoſe Name was
<hi>Alileth;</hi> but, that ſhe being of the <hi>Race</hi> of theſe
<hi>Devils,</hi> refus'd to obey <hi>Adam:</hi> Whence it came to paſs, That
they liv'd in continual Quarrels and Enmity, for the Space of Five Hundred
Years; till at length, <hi>Alileth</hi> flew up into the Air, and abandon'd her
Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band. Of which, when <hi>Adam</hi> complained to <hi>God,</hi> he ſent
Three Mighty <hi>Angels</hi> in Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit of her, commanding them to tell her,
That if ſhe would return to her Husband, it ſhould go well with her; but if
ſhe would not, a Hundred of her Children ſhould die every Day. The
<hi>Angels</hi> follow'd her, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took her on the <hi>Red Sea,</hi> where
they threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to drown her, unleſs ſhe would return to her Husband. But
ſhe made Excuſes, and told them, <hi>She was created to deſtroy Young
Children.</hi> Then the Angels laid Hands on her: When ſhe, to pacifie them,
ſwore by the <hi>Bottom</hi> of <hi>Hell,</hi> That whenſoever the Names of
them Three, ſhould be written on any <hi>Schedule,</hi> that ſhe ſhould
have no Power to hurt the Infants, they diſmiſs'd her. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this,
<hi>God</hi> compaſſionating <hi>Adam</hi>'s Soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, gave him another
Wife call'd <hi>Eve.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This <hi>Tradition,</hi> confirms the <hi>Viſion</hi> of the
<hi>Prophet;</hi> and, we need not doubt, That the <hi>Earth</hi> was Inhabited
before <hi>Adam</hi>'s Time. And, if that be granted, why might it not be
Peopled for Millions of Ages, as well as for the ſmalleſt Term, that
Ignorance or Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror may aſſign to its Duration?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="320" facs="tcp:99492:175"/>I have diſcourſed with ſeveral of
the <hi>Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh Rabbi</hi>'s, and <hi>Chriſtian Doctors</hi> on this
Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, Men of abſtruſe Learning, and ſublime Thoughts: Yet, I can find
but a few, who are emancipated from the Prejudices of a Superſtitious
Education. They have been from their Infancy, prepoſſeſs'd with a falſe
Notion of the <hi>Works</hi> of <hi>God;</hi> believing them to be
<hi>Finite,</hi> both in Extent of <hi>Space</hi> and <hi>Time.</hi> They
circumſcribe this <hi>Viſible World,</hi> within, I know not what
<hi>Flaming Circle;</hi> and believe the <hi>Firſt Matter</hi> it ſelf, to
be but Five Days Older than <hi>Adam,</hi> taking each of thoſe Days, for the
Space of Four and Twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Hours, wherein the Sun finiſhes his Diur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Circuit through the <hi>Heavens.</hi> They con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider not, That according to
their own <hi>Bible,</hi> there was <hi>Light</hi> and <hi>Darkneſs,</hi> and
conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently <hi>Day</hi> and <hi>Night,</hi> before the <hi>Sun</hi> was
<hi>Created.</hi> But, how long thoſe <hi>Days</hi> and <hi>Nights</hi> were,
is not determin'd by <hi>Moſes.</hi> Yet in another Part of their
<hi>Bible,</hi> it is ſaid, That a <hi>Day</hi> with <hi>God,</hi> is a
<hi>Thouſand Years,</hi> and a <hi>Thouſand Years,</hi> is a <hi>Day.</hi>
So that, according to this Interpretation, <hi>Adam</hi> was not Created, till
above <hi>Five Thouſand Years</hi> after the <hi>Beginning</hi> of the
<hi>World.</hi> Yet, when I bring this Poſitive Place of their Own
<hi>Scripture,</hi> againſt the <hi>Nazarene Sages,</hi> they ſhuffle it
off with empty Evaſions; and, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than believe the <hi>Indeſinite
Antiquity</hi> of the <hi>World,</hi> they contradict their own Sence and
Reaſon, invalidate the Teſtimony of a <hi>Prophet,</hi> deny their

               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="321" facs="tcp:99492:175"/>Both <hi>they</hi> and the <hi>Jews,</hi>
have corrupted the Truth with many Errors; and, we muſt ſeek farther, for
the Original Science of Nature. The <hi>Illuminated</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> have
always taught, That the <hi>Earth</hi> was <hi>Inhabited</hi> long before the
Appearance of <hi>Adam.</hi> And, all the <hi>Eaſtern Sages,</hi> believe a
<hi>Series</hi> of <hi>Generations,</hi> to have dwelt on this <hi>Globe,</hi>
for Indeterminate A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges.</p>
               <p>I have a Brother lately come from the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies:</hi> He
relates ſtrange Things of certain <hi>Books,</hi> which are onely in the
Hands of the <hi>Brachmans.</hi> They are written in a <hi>Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage,</hi>
which none underſtand but theſe <hi>Prieſts;</hi> yet a <hi>Language</hi>
as Copious as any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and taught in their <hi>Colleges</hi> by
<hi>Rule.</hi> Theſe <hi>Books</hi> contain a <hi>Hiſtory</hi> of the
<hi>World,</hi> which, they ſay, is above Thirty Millions of Years Old. They
divide the Term of its Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, into <hi>Four Ages; Three</hi> of which they
ſay are already paſt, and a good Part of the <hi>Fourth.</hi> Now I would
fain know, who wrote theſe <hi>Books;</hi> and, at what Time, and where this
<hi>Language</hi> was ſpoken? They call it, the <hi>Holy Language;</hi>
ſaying, that it was the <hi>Firſt</hi> ſpoken on <hi>Earth.</hi> It is
ſtrange, That no <hi>Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory</hi> ſhould mention ſo <hi>Divine</hi> a
<hi>Speech.</hi> We have the <hi>Chronology</hi> of the <hi>Latin</hi> and
<hi>Greek;</hi> and can give an Account, when and where they were ſpoken,
though they are now grown Obſolete, and no otherways to be learn'd, but in
the <hi>Schools</hi> and <hi>Academies.</hi> This ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues, the Antiquity of the
<hi>Bramins Language</hi> and <hi>Books,</hi> in Regard, they fall not within 
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:99492:176"/>any other <hi>Record</hi> ſave their own, which ſays,
they are as Old as the <hi>World.</hi> For, if this Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion were
falſe, the Impoſture would have been diſcover'd as ſoon as broach'd,
and the Learned <hi>Sages</hi> of the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> would quickly have
diſprov'd ſo manifeſt a Lye. There ſeems to me ſomething
Extraordinary, in this Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſion of theſe <hi>Indian Philoſophers,</hi>
and I would gladly be convinc'd of the Truth. Methinks, it is an Illuſtrious
<hi>Idea</hi> of the <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Perfections,</hi> when one conceives all this
Vaſt and Endleſs Concatenation of <hi>Beings,</hi> to flow from the
<hi>Eternal Nature,</hi> as Rays from the Sun: And, that they can no more be
ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated from it, than thoſe Beams can from that <hi>Viſible
Fountain</hi> of <hi>Light.</hi> It will not be difficult then, to Interpret
the <hi>Hiſtory</hi> of <hi>Moſes,</hi> by this <hi>Regiſter</hi> of the
<hi>Bramins,</hi> and reconcile the <hi>Six Days</hi> of the one, with the
<hi>Four Ages</hi> of the other; ſince, a Day in the <hi>Divine</hi> Sence,
may amount to Millions of Years, as well as to a Thouſand. And, it will be
more congruous and agreeable, to believe, that after the Birth of the
<hi>Firſt Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> there elaps'd Many <hi>Ages,</hi> before it was
wrought into ſuch an Infinite Variety of Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances, as we now behold; and,
that the <hi>Five Days,</hi> which <hi>Moſes</hi> computes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the

<hi>Years:</hi> In which Time, the <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Architect</hi> gradually drew

               <p>IN a former <hi>Diſpatch</hi> to thy <hi>Sanctity,</hi> I have
acquainted thee with the <hi>Inſurrections</hi> in <hi>Palermo,</hi>
mentioning the Fear of the <hi>Viceroy,</hi> leſt the <hi>French</hi> in that
<hi>Iſland,</hi> ſhould then take their Opportunity, to revenge the
<hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verbial</hi> Cruelty of the <hi>Sicilian Veſpers.</hi> If thou art
unacquainted with that <hi>Tragedy,</hi> I will inform thee in Brief.</p>
               <p>About Three Hundred and Threeſcore Years ago, there Reign'd in
<hi>Sicily,</hi> one of the <hi>Royal Blood</hi> of <hi>France;</hi> they call
him, <hi>Charles</hi> of <hi>Anjou.</hi> He had <hi>French</hi> Garriſons in
all the Cities of that <hi>Kingdom:</hi> But, theſe Soldiers committed ſo
many Inſolencies, as rendred 'em Odious and Inſupportable to the
<hi>Natives,</hi> 
                  <pb n="324" facs="tcp:99492:177"/>who therefore reſolved to exterminate
them.</p>
               <p>The <hi>French</hi> are very Licentious in their
<hi>Conqueſts;</hi> neither ſparing Men in their An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, nor Women in their
Luſt. They make no Difference, between the <hi>Noble</hi> and the
<hi>Vulgar;</hi> but ſacrifice all the Regards of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and Civility, to
their Impetuous Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petites.</p>
               <p>They were guilty of innumerable Rapes and Violences in
<hi>Sicily,</hi> among the <hi>Meaner</hi> People; and ſometimes, extended
their Rude<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, to Perſons of the <hi>Beſt</hi> Quality. It was common
for them, to affront both Virgins and Matrons as they went along the Streets,
by thruſting their Hands under their Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, on Pretence of ſearching
for hidden Arms. Among the Reſt, the Wife of a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Lord</hi> in
<hi>Palermo,</hi> going to pay her <hi>Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> at the <hi>Temple,</hi>
was ſeiz'd by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the <hi>Captain</hi> of the <hi>Guards,</hi>
and ſtrip'd Naked before all the Soldiers, in Order to diſcover certain
Treaſonable Papers, which they ſuſpected ſhe carried about her. But
finding none, ſhe upbraided the <hi>Captain</hi> with Inhumanity, in offering
ſo groſs an Affront, to a <hi>Lady</hi> of her <hi>Rank.</hi> He ſeeming
to be ſorry for the Indignity ſhe had received, begged her Pardon; and
retiring with his Soldiers out of the Room where ſhe was, left her to put on
her Apparel. In the mean while, he was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed with a furious Paſſion for
this <hi>Lady,</hi> (ſhe being very Beautiful;) and having ſent the
Soldiers away, he return'd to the Room where ſhe was. He addreſs'd her with
much <pb n="325" facs="tcp:99492:177"/>Courtſhip; but, finding that Ineffectual, he
Forc'd her.</p>
               <p>When this was made known to her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, he burn'd with
Deſire of Revenge. And ſtirring up all the <hi>Sicilian Nobles</hi> and
<hi>People,</hi> it was privately agreed between them, that on a certain
<hi>Feſtival,</hi> when the <hi>Bells</hi> ſhould toll to
<hi>Even-Song,</hi> all the <hi>Sicilians</hi> ſhould take Arms, and
Maſſacre the <hi>French</hi> throughout the <hi>Iſland.</hi> This
<hi>Plot</hi> was carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſo ſecretly, that before the <hi>French</hi>
could get the leaſt Intimation of it, they were all murd'red, on the Day
appointed.</p>
               <p>I forgot to acquaint thee in my laſt, with a Villainy, which
was diſcover'd in the late Tumults of <hi>Naples.</hi> As they were march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
up and Down the Streets, burning the <hi>Cuſtom-Houſes,</hi> and the
Habitations of thoſe who had been concern'd in gathering the <hi>Taxes,</hi>
they entred the Houſe of a certain <hi>Notary</hi> or <hi>Publick Scribe</hi>
of that City, who had been repreſented to them, as a Promoter of thoſe
Unreaſonable <hi>Impoſitions.</hi> They ſei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed on the Man, and began to
carry his Goods out into the Streets, in Order to be burnt. But, as they were
rummaging in an Apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which was toward the Gardens, they heard a great
Shrieking, as of Women af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frighted: And, perceiving the Voice to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from
within a Wall in the Room where they were, they ſearch'd about for a Door to
enter into that Place; but finding none, they broke through the Wall, where
they found Two Women, with their Hair hanging down <pb n="326" facs="tcp:99492:178"/>to
their Ancles, and their Nails grown like the Talons of an Eagle. Enquiring of
them how long they had been there, and on what Occaſion, the Eldeſt of the
Women made this Anſwer; <hi>The Maſter of this Houſe, is my own Brother,
who when my Father died, was entruſted by him, to pay me Six Hundred Duckets,
which he bequeath'd me as a Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gacy, for my Maintenance, my Husband being dead:
But my Brother, inſtead of doing me this Juſtice, Immur'd both me and my
Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, whom you ſee here, between theſe Walls, where we have lived
theſe Seventeen Years, being allowed, by this cruel Man, no other Food but
Bread and Water.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The People Incens'd above Meaſure, at ſo barbarous a
Cruelty, hang'd up the <hi>Notary,</hi> and gave all his Eſtate, to this
Widow and her Daughter. An <hi>Exemplary</hi> Piece of <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice,</hi>
performed by <hi>Mutineers,</hi> which could not have been done by the
<hi>Law,</hi> the Crime not reaching his Life; though, in the Sence of all Men,
he merited Death. This is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Argument, that <hi>Deſtiny</hi> had a Hand
in this <hi>Inſurrection;</hi> and, that <hi>Maſanello</hi> the

himſelf Inexcuſable, by doing any Injuſtice himſelf.</p>

               </head>
               <p>THE <hi>Arabian Proverb</hi> ſays, <hi>There is more Danger to
be fear'd from one of the</hi> Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reis, <hi>than from a Thouſand</hi>
Bobeck's. Thou knoweſt, both theſe were <hi>Noble Families</hi> in
<hi>Mecca,</hi> and Sworn Enemies of the <hi>Meſſenger</hi> of
<hi>God:</hi> But, the <hi>Latter,</hi> as their <hi>Name</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports, were
too open in their Counſels, to do any conſiderable Execution againſt the
<hi>Holy One:</hi> Whereas the <hi>Former,</hi> were always reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and
laying of Secret Trains.</p>
               <p>Such is <hi>Cardinal Mazarini,</hi> the Hidden Enemy of the
<hi>Ottoman Empire.</hi> There ſeems to be an Ambition in this Great
<hi>Genius,</hi> equal to that of his Predeceſſor <hi>Richlieu,</hi> who
would be eſteemed the moſt Eminent among Men. Nothing will ſatisfie this
<hi>Miniſter,</hi> leſs than a Subverſion of all the <hi>Monarchies</hi>
on Earth, which appear Obſtacles of that <hi>Grandeur,</hi> to which he
Deſigns to raiſe his <hi>Maſter.</hi> Yet, he attempts not this by Open
Force, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that is impracticable: but, acts in the Dark, ſtriving to
undermine thoſe <hi>States</hi> by <hi>Intrigue,</hi> which he cannot
ſubdue by <hi>Arms.</hi> He has his <hi>Agents</hi> in all the
<hi>Courts</hi> of <hi>Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom;</hi> and, thou needeſt not ſtartle,
if I tell thee, there is Ground to ſuſpect, he is not without his
<hi>Creatures</hi> at the <hi>Sublime Port.</hi> All <hi>Europe</hi> is
ſenſible, that the Late <hi>Revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> 
                  <pb n="328" facs="tcp:99492:179"/>in
<hi>Portugal</hi> and <hi>Catalonia,</hi> the <hi>Inſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions</hi> in
<hi>Sicily</hi> and <hi>Naples,</hi> and the <hi>Rebellion</hi> of the
<hi>Engliſh, Scots</hi> and <hi>Iriſh,</hi> are, in Part, owing to the
<hi>Policies</hi> of this <hi>Miniſter:</hi> And, I can tell thee more on
that Subject, than is known to every one.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Oſmin</hi> the <hi>Dwarf,</hi> who ſtill retains his
good Inclinations to the <hi>Sublime Port,</hi> finds an inſuſpected
Acceſs to all the <hi>Grandees,</hi> to whom the Smallneſs of his Bulk and
Stature, affords no ſmall Divertiſement. Beſides, they delight to poſe
him with <hi>Problems,</hi> in Regard, there is always ſomething ſo lucky,
beſides the Wit in his Anſwers, as either creates Admiration or Laughter.
But, their Mirth would quickly be changed into other Paſſions, were they
ſenſible, that their Little <hi>Buffoon,</hi> is no other than a
<hi>Spy</hi> upon them. For, <hi>Oſmin</hi> having ſo many. Opportunities,
lurks in Corners like a Spider, undiſcovered, and unthought-of: He Creeps
into their Bedchambers and Cabinets, where he becomes privy to their greateſt
Secrets. If they ſhould catch him in any of his Concealments, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind the
Hangings, or under a Bed, 'twould only paſs for a Frolick to give 'em
Diverſion; and, he never wants for a <hi>Repartee</hi> or a <hi>Jeſt,</hi>
to bring himſelf off.</p>
               <p>I have taught him a <hi>Cypher,</hi> which he makes Uſe of, to
tranſcribe any Letters, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Papers of Moment; with <hi>Characters</hi>
for <hi>Speedy Writing,</hi> which comprehend whole Sentences in a Daſh or
Two of the Pen.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="329" facs="tcp:99492:179"/>'Tis but lately, we have pitched on this
Method; and, the firſt Attempt <hi>Oſmin</hi> made, was in <hi>Cardinal
Mazarini</hi>'s Cloſet: Into which he ſlipt under the Skirt of a
<hi>Nobleman</hi>'s Cloak, who juſt then went in to ſpeak with the
<hi>Cardinal.</hi> This active <hi>Dwarf,</hi> taking Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of the
<hi>Nobleman</hi>'s Approach to the Table, dextrouſly crept under the Carpets
which cover'd it, reaching down to the Floor, where he lay unſeen, till the
<hi>Cardinal</hi> was gone, and the <hi>Cloſet</hi> lock'd up.</p>
               <p>During the Time of their Conference, which was not very long,
<hi>Oſmin</hi> heard the <hi>Cardinal</hi> ſpeak theſe Words to the
<hi>Lord: One of the Slaves of that Baſſa,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>is an</hi>
Italian, <hi>whom I formerly entertain'd in my Service, and one in whom I
confide: He was taken by the</hi> Turks <hi>at Sea; and, as ſoon as he was
ſold to this</hi> Grandee, <hi>he acquainted me in a Letter, with his
Condition, imploring my Aſſiſtance to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward his Ranſom. I promis'd to
Redeem him, on the Conditions I have told you; and ſince that, he has not
fail'd to perform them; his</hi> Maſter <hi>having accepted the</hi>
Piſtols, <hi>and enter'd into the</hi> Aſſociation: <hi>So that I hope in
a little Time, to ſee that proud</hi> Tyrannical Race <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminated,
the</hi> Tartars <hi>excluded from Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion, and the</hi> Empire
<hi>divided by the</hi> Sword <hi>of</hi> Strangers. Ragotski <hi>is the onely
Obſtacle; That</hi> Prince <hi>is wavering, and we cannot truſt him.
The</hi> Baſſa <hi>of</hi> Aleppo, <hi>with thoſe of</hi> Sidon,
Damaſcus <hi>and</hi> Babylon, <hi>are ready to cover the Fields of</hi>
Aſia <hi>with their Armies. If Things were as ſecure on the Side of</hi>
Europe, <hi>the</hi> Blow <hi>ſhould ſoon be given.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="330" facs="tcp:99492:180"/>There paſs'd ſome other Diſcourſe
between them, which <hi>Oſmin</hi> could not diſtinguiſh, in Regard, they
removed to the Window, and ſpoke low. But, this was enough to rowze his
Curioſity, and put him on a farther In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſition.</p>
               <p>As ſoon as the <hi>Room</hi> was void, by their Abſence, he
came forth from his Retirement, and fell to examining the Papers, which lay on
the Table, hoping to diſcover more of this <hi>Plot;</hi> but, he was
diſappointed, and only met with a few Letters from his <hi>Agents</hi> in
<hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland.</hi> Wherein, among other Matters, they gave the
<hi>Cardinal</hi> an Account, <hi>That they had hunted the</hi> Lion <hi>into
the</hi> Toils, <hi>paſt all Hopes of an Eſcape.</hi> By which, I
ſuppoſe, they meant the <hi>Engliſh</hi> King, whom the <hi>Rebels</hi>
have confined to a certain <hi>Caſtle</hi> in their Poſſeſſion.
<hi>Oſmin</hi> tranſcribed ſome of theſe Letters, and brought them to
me: A Copy of one of them, I here ſend thee encloſed. 'Twas written from
the <hi>Council</hi> of the <hi>Iriſh Rebels.</hi> By which thou mayſt
ſee, what a Share the <hi>Cardinal</hi> has, in abetting theſe
<hi>Traytors.</hi> Elſe, how could they Demand of him, <hi>The Performance of
the</hi> Queen-Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent'<hi>s Promiſe, to aſſiſt them with Money and
Men?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There is one alſo Dated this preſent Year, and Subſcribed
by Monſieur <hi>Bellieure,</hi> the <hi>French Embaſſador</hi> in
<hi>England.</hi> But, <hi>Oſmin</hi> had not time to tranſcribe that,
being pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented by the <hi>Cardinal</hi>'s Return; which made the
<hi>Dwarf</hi> ſnatch up his Tools, and <pb n="331" facs="tcp:99492:180"/>abſcond under
the <hi>Table.</hi> Yet, he remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bered ſome of the Contents of that Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and told them me at his next Viſit: The <hi>Ambaſſador</hi> in that
Letter, informs the <hi>Cardinal,</hi> of a certain <hi>German Prophet,</hi>
who foretold, <hi>That there ſhould be a great Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volution in the Government
of</hi> England; <hi>and, that One of the Mightieſt of all the</hi> Eaſtern
Princes, <hi>ſhould be Depoſed this Year, and Murdred by his</hi> Subjects
(I pray <hi>Heaven,</hi> avert the <hi>Omen</hi> from the <hi>Seraglio.</hi>)
He ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaints this <hi>Miniſter</hi> alſo, That he had ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded in his
Negotiation with the Officers of the <hi>Rebels</hi> Army. There were other
ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure Paſſages in the Letter, which <hi>Oſmin</hi> has forgot. But,
theſe are ſufficient to demonſtrate, how buſie the <hi>Cardinal</hi>
is, and what a Hand he has in <hi>Foreign</hi> Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs.</p>
               <p>Another Opportunity, I hope, will bring to Light, more of this
<hi>Miniſter</hi>'s Secrets. Adieu.</p>

               <head>LETTER XV. To <hi>Peſtelihali,</hi> his Brother.</head>
               <p>THE oftner I peruſe the <hi>Journal</hi> of thy
<hi>Travels,</hi> the more I am delighted with it. For, it is evident, That the
<hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries</hi> through which thou haſt paſs'd, have been as ſo many
<hi>Schools</hi> of <hi>Wiſdom</hi> to thee; Wherein thou haſt learn'd,
even from Mens <hi>Vices,</hi> the Way to <hi>Perfection;</hi> much more from
their <hi>Vertues.</hi> Thou haſt found, that though Mens <hi>Natural</hi>
Diſpoſitions differ, as do the <hi>Climates,</hi> which afford them Breath;
yet, they all agree in <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Frailties.</hi> There are alſo
<hi>Vices</hi> pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar to certain <hi>Countries;</hi> 'twere to be wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
they could be match'd with as many <hi>National Vertues.</hi> But, <hi>Human
Nature</hi> is a <hi>Rank Soil,</hi> more fertile in <hi>Weeds,</hi> than
<hi>whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom Products.</hi> Yet, there are <hi>Gardens</hi> as well as
<hi>Deſarts:</hi> And, thou haſt obſerved ſome Perſons, Illuſtrious
for their Goodneſs, and the Noble Endowments of their Minds.</p>
               <p>I am extreamly pleaſed with that rare Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of
Generoſity, which thou relateſt of an <hi>Indian</hi> Merchant; who, not
content to give Alms to all that ask'd him, or whom he knew to be Poor,
ſought daily Occaſions to exerciſe his Charity, hunted out the Indigent
and Unfortunate: And, where-ever he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered the Lineaments of Poverty in
a <pb n="333" facs="tcp:99492:181"/>Man's Face, or trac'd the Footſteps of it in his
Behaviour, he could not reſt till he had relieved his Wants, and made him
Happy, to his very Wiſhes. I tell thee, <hi>Poverty</hi> is a <hi>Hell</hi>
upon <hi>Earth;</hi> and, he that has this Curſe, anticipates the
<hi>Torments</hi> of the <hi>Damn'd.</hi> It eclipſes the brighteſt
Vertues, and is the very Sepulcher of brave Deſigns; depriving a Man of the
Means to accompliſh, what <hi>Nature</hi> has fitted him for, and ſtifling
the Nobleſt Thoughts in their <hi>Embryo.</hi> How many Illuſtrious Souls
may be ſaid, to have been Dead among the Living, or buried alive in the
Obſcurity of their Condition, whoſe Perfections have rendred 'em, the
<hi>Darlings</hi> of <hi>Providence,</hi> and <hi>Companions</hi> of
<hi>Angels;</hi> yet the inſuperable Penury of all Things, has ranked them
among the <hi>Caſtaways</hi> of the <hi>Earth,</hi> in the Eyes of Men? To
ſuch as theſe, our <hi>Divine Lawgiver</hi> commands us to extend our
Charity, giving us certain Characters and Marks, by which we may
diſtinguiſh them from the Crowd of the Unfortunate. And, I like the
<hi>Indian</hi>'s Bounty the better, in that he ſo exactly ſeems to comply
with this <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept</hi> of the <hi>Alcoran,</hi> generouſly preventing
the Requeſts of the Indigent, and by an Exceſs of Benignity, courting them
to except of Relief. In this he alſo verifies the <hi>Arabian Proverb,</hi>
which ſays, <hi>He gives Double, who gives unask'd.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thou commendeſt the Induſtry of the <hi>Chineſe,</hi> the
Advances they have made in Arts and Sciences, which, thou concludeſt, is 
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:99492:182"/>to be attributed to the Force of their <hi>Laws,</hi>
which oblige the Son to follow his Father's Trade, throughout all Generations.
In this I muſt diſſent; for, it ſeems rather a Curb than a Spur to
Ingenuity, to be confin'd to Employments, for which a Man may have an
Averſion. The Son not ſeldom aborring thoſe Things, wherein his Parents
took De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light. Or, if not ſo, yet he may be caſt in a Finer Mold, have a
more ſubtile Invention; and conſequently, be capable of making greater
Improvements, in any Trade of his own Choice: Since, Delight ſets an Edge on
the Mind, gives Vigor to the Body, and adds Wings to Buſineſs. Beſides, I
do not think this to be ſo much thy own Remark, as the Inſinuation of
ſome of that Country, who are the moſt Conceited People in the World; ever
extolling their own <hi>Policy, Laws</hi> and <hi>Government;</hi> and
impoſing them as a Pattern, to all other Nations.</p>
               <p>One Thing I grant, they boaſt of with a great Deal of Truth,
that is, their Antiquity and unmix'd Race. Though, ſince the
<hi>Conqueſt</hi> the <hi>Tartars</hi> have made of that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, they are
like to undergo the Fate of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Nations, and Corrupt their
<hi>Genealogies</hi> with the <hi>Blood</hi> of <hi>Strangers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thou cameſt away before that <hi>Conqueſt</hi> was begun, or
perhaps, before 'twas talked of. And, I can give thee, but a very Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect
Account of it. All the Intelligence we have from that <hi>Kingdom</hi> of late,
comes in Fragments: For, the Ships which bring this <pb n="335" facs="tcp:99492:182"/>ſhatter'd News, left <hi>China</hi> in an Uproar and Confuſion.
Only they aſſure us, That the <hi>Tartars</hi> had paſſed the
Celebrated <hi>Wall,</hi> which divides them from <hi>China;</hi> that they
entred and ſubdued the <hi>Northern Provinces,</hi> with an Army of Six
Hundred Thouſand Men; that very little Reſiſtance was made againſt
them, not even in <hi>Pequin</hi> it ſelf, the <hi>Capital Seat</hi> of the
<hi>Chineſe Empire,</hi> which the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurper Lycungz</hi> had abandon'd
to the <hi>Conquerors,</hi> carrying away with him, all the Ineſtimable
Treaſures of the <hi>Palace,</hi> and retiring into one of the remote
<hi>Provinces,</hi> was never heard of afterwards. Whence it was judg'd, That
ſome of his own Party had murder'd him; partly, for the Sake of his
prodigious Wealth, which they ſhared among them; and partly, to revenge his
<hi>Treaſon</hi> againſt the <hi>Emperor,</hi> and the Innumerable
Calamities he had brought upon his Country.</p>
               <p>Before theſe <hi>Merchants</hi> came away, the <hi>Cham</hi>
of <hi>Tartary</hi> was proclaimed in <hi>Pequin,</hi> and Crowned
<hi>Emperor</hi> of <hi>China.</hi> They ſay, He was not above Thirteen Years
Old at that Time; which was, in the 12th. <hi>Moon,</hi> of the Year 1644. And,
that having ſent for the Chief <hi>Nobility</hi> of <hi>Tartary</hi> to
<hi>Pequin,</hi> he made Preparations, to purſue his Conqueſts.</p>
               <p>This is the beſt Account we yet have, of the Affairs of that
<hi>Empire.</hi> By which thou wilt eaſily be induced to be of my Opinion,
That the <hi>Blood</hi> of the <hi>Chineſes,</hi> will in Time be mix'd with
that of <hi>Strangers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="336" facs="tcp:99492:183"/>We muſt not ſeek for the Originals of
any People, in the Country where they dwell. The moſt Renowned
<hi>Kingdoms</hi> and <hi>Empires</hi> in the <hi>World,</hi> had their firſt
Foundations laid by <hi>Vagabonds</hi> and <hi>Fugitives.</hi> Thou art not
ignorant, how vaſt an Extent, the Ancient <hi>Roman Empire</hi> had through
<hi>Aſia, Africk</hi> and <hi>Europe.</hi> Yet, that City which was called
the <hi>Miſtreſs</hi> of <hi>Nations,</hi> the <hi>Governeſs</hi> of the
Whole <hi>Earth,</hi> was firſt built by a handful of <hi>Banditi,</hi>
People who lived by Pillage and Robbery, the Outlaws and Scum of
<hi>Italy,</hi> aſſembled together from divers Parts, under the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of
<hi>Romulus</hi> and <hi>Rhemus.</hi> Neither had that City, proved any better
than a Sepulcher to them and their Deſigns, had they not by a witty
Stratagem, over-reach'd the <hi>Sabine</hi> Women, and ſo ſecured to
themſelves a Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity, who ſhould not only defend but enlarge the
Dominions of their Fathers. Yet, theſe People of ſo Obſcure and

               <p>To look no farther than the great and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable
<hi>Empire</hi> of the <hi>Oſmans,</hi> we ſhall find it took its firſt
Riſe from <hi>Colonies</hi> of Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſplanted <hi>Scythians;</hi> ſo that
he who would have the <hi>Genealogy</hi> of a <hi>Turk,</hi> muſt not look in
the <hi>Regiſters</hi> of <hi>Greece,</hi> where they now live, but muſt
carry his Search beyond the Mountain <hi>Caucaſus,</hi> examine the Border of
<hi>Palus Maeotis,</hi> or hunt his <hi>Pedigree</hi> ous <pb n="337" facs="tcp:99492:183"/>in <hi>Cherſoneſus.</hi> What <hi>Revolutions</hi> have not
happen'd in <hi>Aſia</hi> and <hi>Africk,</hi> ſince the

<hi>Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe?</hi> Where ſhall we now find any Remains of the Ancient
<hi>Saracens,</hi> or <hi>Mamalukes?</hi> The Mighty <hi>Empire</hi> of the

and, there is ſo general a Mixture of <hi>Foreign Blood,</hi> made by the
Converſion of innumerable different Nations to the <hi>Muſſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Faith,</hi> that it is hard to know, Whether our <hi>Anceſtors</hi> were
<hi>Scythians</hi> or <hi>Perſians, Jews</hi> or <hi>Grecians;</hi> Whether
they were of the Mountains or the Valleys, of the Foreſts or the Plains.</p>
               <p>In this I will except my Countrymen, the <hi>Arabians,</hi> and
thoſe who ſeem to approach neareſt them in Manner of Life, the
<hi>Tartars;</hi> the one dwelling in Tents, the other in Wag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gons; both in a

               </head>
               <p>THE <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Chaſtillon,</hi> arrived here Six
Days ago from the Army in <hi>Flanders,</hi> bringing News of a Signal Victory,
obtained by the Young <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Conde,</hi> on the <hi>Plains</hi>
of <hi>Lens.</hi> This Battel was fought, on the 20th. of the laſt
<hi>Moon,</hi> the <hi>French</hi> having entirely rou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the
<hi>Spaniards,</hi> kill'd Three Thouſand of them on the Spot, taken Six
Thouſand Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, with all their Artillery and Baggage. And, to crown
the Day, they have taken <hi>Lens</hi> alſo.</p>
               <p>But, though <hi>Fortune</hi> thus favours their Arms Abroad,
ſhe has mixed Poiſon with their Counſels at Home. All Things here ſeem
to portend a <hi>Civil War.</hi> The <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> thwart the
Proceedings of the <hi>Court,</hi> taking on them, the Power of the Ancient
<hi>Spartan Ephori:</hi> They will be Comptrollers of the <hi>Regal</hi>
Authority, ſuppreſſing the King's <hi>Edicts,</hi> calling his Expences
to Account; and, pretending to reform the <hi>Court,</hi> they play the
<hi>Paedagogues</hi> with their <hi>Sovereign.</hi> On the other Side,
<hi>Cardinal Mazarini,</hi> the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Orleans,</hi> and other
<hi>Grandees,</hi> do their ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt Endeavours, to diſſolve the Meetings
of this <hi>Senate.</hi> They perſwade the Young King, that it is but a
<hi>Precarious Reign,</hi> where the <hi>Sovereign</hi> muſt be curb'd by his
<hi>Subjects.</hi> Thus they inſtill into his tender Years, thoſe 
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:99492:185"/>
                  <hi>Maxims</hi> by which they would have him Rule, when
he comes of Age.</p>
               <p>There is a Man in the <hi>Parliament,</hi> whom they call
<hi>Monſieur Bruſſels,</hi> one of their Great Counſellors, a bitter
Enemy of <hi>Cardinal Mazarini,</hi> and therefore cry'd up by the
<hi>People,</hi> for a <hi>Patriot:</hi> He is of a furious Temper, and mean
Abilities; yet his noiſy Zeal for the <hi>Publick Liberty,</hi> has
faſtened to him the Vulgar: He is become the <hi>Ring-leader</hi> of the
<hi>Seditious.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Man was ſeized, as he returned from the Chief
<hi>Temple,</hi> where <hi>Te Deum</hi> was ſung Yeſterday, for the late
Victory in <hi>Flanders.</hi> And, ſome are of Opinion, that 'twas this
hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py News, which emboldned the <hi>Court,</hi> to ſnatch from the People
their <hi>Darling,</hi> their <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dol,</hi> the Man from whoſe Courage,
they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect a Redreſs of all their <hi>Grievances.</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, one may
ſay, it would ſeem ſafer for a Traveller in the <hi>Deſarts</hi> of
<hi>Arabia,</hi> to tear from a <hi>Lioneſs</hi> her Young One. For, the
<hi>Heads</hi> of the <hi>Faction,</hi> waited but for ſuch an Opportunity,
to ſet all in a Flame. And, the ill Succeſs of the <hi>Court</hi> in this
Action, ſhews, That it is dangerous to provoke the <hi>Multitude.</hi> For,
preſently we were all in Confuſion, the <hi>Burgeſſes</hi> in Arms, the
Shops ſhut up, the Streets Chained, and all the Avenues of the
<hi>Palace</hi> barricado'd. The <hi>Rabble</hi> marched up and down the
Streets, threatning Deſtruction to <hi>Cardinal Mazarini,</hi> and all his
<hi>Party.</hi> The <hi>Parliament</hi> were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to become the
<hi>Meſſengers</hi> of the <hi>People,</hi> 
                  <pb n="341" facs="tcp:99492:185"/>to carry
their <hi>Petitions,</hi> or rather their <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands</hi> to the
<hi>Court;</hi> being threatned alſo, if they failed of Succeſs. For, they
proteſted Unanimouſly, that they would not lay down their Arms, till the
Impriſoned <hi>Counſellor</hi> was Releaſed.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Queen</hi> appeared at firſt Inexorable and ſent
theſe <hi>Senators</hi> away with Denial and, Scoffs; wiſhing them Joy of
their New <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,</hi> in being made the <hi>Porters</hi> of the
<hi>Rabble.</hi> And, the Young <hi>Monarch,</hi> incenſed to ſee his
<hi>Native Royalty,</hi> thus Prophaned by his <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,</hi> bent his
Brows; and caſting a Look, divided betwixt Majeſty and Diſdain, on the
<hi>Senators,</hi> uttered theſe Words: <hi>Sirs, Shall it always be a
Cuſtom, thus to moleſt the</hi> Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nority <hi>of your</hi> Kings? <hi>Or,
do you think Our tender Years, incapable of the Common Senſe of other
Mortals, that you preſume thus Inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently to invade our Right? Accuſe
not the</hi> Multitude, <hi>nor make them an <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>mbrage to your</hi> Sedition.
<hi>I know the Authors of theſe Tumults; and ſhall find a Time, to make 'em
feel the Weight of my Diſpleaſure. Think not that I wear this Sword, only
for Ornament,</hi> [laying his Hand fiercely on the Hilt] <hi>or, that the</hi>
Blood <hi>of my Renowned</hi> Anceſtors, <hi>is grown degenerate, or turned
to Lees within my Veins. Go tell your Factious Comrades, There ſits this Day
upon the</hi> Throne <hi>of</hi> France <hi>a King, who, though he's Young, yet
has a Spirit and Memory, which will outlaſt his Pupillage.</hi> With that, he
commanded them out of his Sight.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="342" facs="tcp:99492:186"/>Yet, notwithſtanding this, the
<hi>People</hi> threatned, to bring their <hi>Darling</hi> away by Force, if he
were not Releaſed in Two Hours.</p>
               <p>There were above a Hundred Thouſand of them in Arms, and it
might have proved a dangerous <hi>Inſurrection.</hi> But, the <hi>Queen,</hi>
at the Second return of the <hi>Senators,</hi> heark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to the Advice of
<hi>Mazarini,</hi> and the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Orleans,</hi> and remembring
the late dreadful Effects of <hi>Maſanello</hi>'s Tumult in <hi>Naples,</hi>
releas'd the Priſoner; who was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted Home laſt Night in Triumph, by an
Infinite Crowd of People, who filled the Air with Shouts and Acclamations.</p>
               <p>It is diſcourſed here, That the <hi>Prince</hi> of
<hi>Conde</hi> will ſpeedily return to <hi>Paris.</hi> From whom, both the
<hi>Court,</hi> and the <hi>Faction,</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe themſelves new Grounds
of Triumph.</p>
               <p>During theſe <hi>Commotions, Mahmut</hi> fails not to act his

City, like Flies in this hot Seaſon, and ſting the <hi>Multitude</hi> to
Fury, with their Stories. I ſpare no Coſt, to procure the
<hi>Cardinal</hi>'s Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine. That pernicious Wit comes not ſhort of his

in <hi>Germany, Flanders, Italy</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> has left him No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing

came. But, the pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent <hi>Philoſopher</hi> appeas'd them both, and one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
deſir'd a Suit of the Ladies Apparel; which was granted him. He ſoon put it
on, and hiding his Sword under his Robes, enter'd the <hi>Sedan,</hi>
perſonating the Lady. The Meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, who knew no other, carried him
away to the <hi>Emperour.</hi> He heighten'd with Deſire, made haſt to open
the <hi>Sedan</hi> himſelf. When <hi>Athenodorus</hi> ſuddenly drawing his
Sword, leap'd forth upon him, ſaying, <hi>Thus mighteſt Thou have been
Murder'd: Wilt thou never quit the Vice, which is attended with ſo much
Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger? Jealouſie and Revenge might have ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted an</hi>
Aſſaſſin <hi>thus diſguis'd in my Room: But, I took Care of thy Life.
Henceforth take Warning.</hi> The <hi>Emperour</hi> pleas'd with the
<hi>Philoſopher</hi>'s Stratagem, gave him Ten Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents of Gold, thanking him
for this ſeaſonable Correction: And, from that Time, began to refrain
Unlawful Pleaſures, applying him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to a Vertuous Life.</p>

               <p>AT length, the <hi>Deputies</hi> of the <hi>Nazarene
Princes</hi> at <hi>Munſter,</hi> have concluded a <hi>Peace.</hi> They have
been theſe Six Years, debating about Trifles and <hi>Punctilio's,</hi> as is
the Manner of the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> even in the moſt Important Affairs.
This <hi>Treaty</hi> was Sign'd, the 24th. of the laſt <hi>Moon;</hi> when
all farther Hoſtilities ceas'd on all Sides, except on the Parts of
<hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> whoſe Quarrel could by no Means be
adjuſted, in this <hi>General Agreement</hi> of <hi>Chriſtendom.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="352" facs="tcp:99492:191"/>Thou haſt by this Time, heard of the
late Tumults and Emotions in this City; the Diſaffection between the
<hi>Court</hi> and <hi>Parliament,</hi> with the Short Siege of <hi>Paris.</hi>
Now Things ſeem to be compos'd, and in a Calm. But, it may only prove a
<hi>Truce,</hi> while both <hi>Parties</hi> take Breath, to ruſh up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on each
other with the greater Violence. The <hi>City</hi> is unmeaſurably Rich and
Popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, and can Arm an Hundred Thouſand Men at an Hours Warning. The
<hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> abets their Quarrel. This encourages them to vye with the
<hi>Court.</hi> The <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants</hi> live like <hi>Petty Kings:</hi>
Abundance of Gold, fills them with Pride and Ambition. Whilſt the
<hi>Court,</hi> in the mean Time, are Cloſe and Reſerv'd, projecting how to
deſtroy the <hi>Faction,</hi> and aſſert the <hi>Regal Authority.</hi>
The <hi>Queen-Regent,</hi> is Reſolute and Severe; yet ſuffers her ſelf
to be Mollify'd, with the Milder Counſels of <hi>Cardinal Mazarini,</hi> and
the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Orleans.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the Beginning of this <hi>Reign,</hi> I gave an Account to
the <hi>Miniſters</hi> of the <hi>Port,</hi> of the <hi>Duke</hi> of
<hi>Beaufort</hi>'s Impriſonment in the <hi>Caſtle</hi> of the
<hi>Wood</hi> of <hi>Vinciennes,</hi> which is one of the <hi>King's
Palaces.</hi> This <hi>Prince,</hi> is now eſcap'd from his Confinement, and
come into the City. The <hi>Factious</hi> cry him up for a <hi>Patriot,</hi>
and are reſolv'd to protect him, with their Lives and Fortunes.</p>
               <p>If thou yet retaineſt thy Health and Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gor, thou art Happy.
As for me, I feel conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual Decays: Yet am not troubled; perceiving 
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:99492:191"/>at the ſame Time, that I approach nearer to
<hi>Immortality.</hi> Wherefore, I neither ſeek <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoratives,</hi> nor

Gradually, I die with Pleaſure, Pluming and preparing my ſelf daily, as one
ready to take Wing for a more <hi>Happy Region.</hi>

               <p>I Am not ſurpriz'd at the News of <hi>Sultan Ibrahim</hi>'s

induce her Conſent. She always affected to Rule; and therefore, could not

her Advice. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, ſhe could not eaſily forget her Diſgrace and

               <p>
                  <pb n="354" facs="tcp:99492:192"/>But, I am aſtoniſh'd and vex'd to
hear, That the <hi>Mufti</hi> ſhould be concern'd in ſo <hi>Black</hi> a
<hi>Tragedy.</hi> How ſhall we have the Confidence hereafter, to reproach the
<hi>Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> with their frequent <hi>Treaſons</hi> and
<hi>Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>d'ring</hi> of their <hi>Kings;</hi> ſince it will be eaſie for
them to retort, That the <hi>Supreme Patriarch</hi> of Our <hi>Law,</hi> has
enter'd into the <hi>Secret</hi> of <hi>Rebels,</hi> Conſpir'd the
<hi>Death</hi> of his <hi>Sovereign,</hi> and caus'd him to be <hi>Depos'd</hi>
and <hi>Strangled?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As for the <hi>Aga</hi> of the <hi>Janizaries,</hi> I
ſuppoſe him rather over-aw'd into the <hi>Conſpiracy,</hi> by the
<hi>Forcible Reaſons</hi> and <hi>Elegant Parole</hi> of the <hi>Mufti,</hi>
than any ways Voluntarily engaging himſelf in Crimes, to which he ſeems to
have no Inclination. Beſides, he could not refuſe to make one in the
<hi>Party,</hi> after it had once been propos'd to him; unleſs he were
reſolv'd, to be the Firſt <hi>Victim</hi> of their Jealouſie, and be
Murdred himſelf, to prevent the Diſcovery of the Reſt. Yet, his Duty and
Honour, ought to have ſuperſeded all other Conſiderations: And, he
ſhould have choſen to Die in his Allegiance, rather than to live ſtain'd
with ſo foul a Crime.</p>
               <p>However it be, I cannot approve their <hi>Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</hi> For,
whatever the <hi>Vices</hi> of the <hi>Sultan</hi> were, <hi>they</hi> had no
Right to puniſh him. He was accountable to None but <hi>God:</hi> And, they
invaded the <hi>Prerogative</hi> of <hi>Heaven,</hi> in Dethroning
<hi>Him,</hi> whom the <hi>Divine Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,</hi> had inveſted with the
<hi>Imperial Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Much leſs can I approve their Impiety, in Defaming him now he
is dead. Neither can I <pb n="355" facs="tcp:99492:192"/>in Conſcience comply with the
Injunctions of the <hi>Mufti,</hi> who has commanded me in a Letter, to
ſpread an Ill Character of <hi>Sultan Ibrahim</hi> among the
<hi>Chriſtians,</hi> that ſo his own Proceedings may appear Juſt. 'Tis
true, I owe Much to the Authority of this <hi>Sovereign Guide</hi> of <hi>True
Believers;</hi> yet I muſt not, to pay this Debt, turn Bankrupt of my
Reaſon: I owe Something to my Self, and to the <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhing
Character</hi> of a <hi>Man.</hi> I promis'd him indeed to obey his Commands in
this Point: But, he that has given me a <hi>Diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation</hi> for all the
Lyes and Perjuries I ſhall be guilty of in <hi>Paris;</hi> will, I hope,
pardon me, if I turn my Own <hi>Confeſſor,</hi> and Abſolve my ſelf,
for not performing my Word to him in this Point.</p>
               <p>I am not often guilty of Aſperſing the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, but I abhor
to Injure the Dead: Leſt I ſhould incurr the <hi>Fate</hi> of him, who
being at Enmity with a Famous <hi>Wraſtler,</hi> purſu'd him with Malice
and Revenge even in his Grave. For, envying the Honour that was due to this
<hi>Wraſtler</hi>'s Memory, in that his <hi>Statue</hi> was ſet up in a
<hi>Publick Place,</hi> he went privately one Night, with Deſign to throw the
<hi>Statue</hi> down, But, after he had ſpightfully Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figur'd it in
ſeveral Parts with a Hammer, and was buſie in working its Overthrow; the
<hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage,</hi> on a ſuddain, fell on him, and cruſh'd him to Death. As if
the Spirit of him, whom it repreſented, had given it this Fall, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge
the Malice of his Adverſary.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="356" facs="tcp:99492:193"/>Certainly, the <hi>Ancients</hi> were not
ignorant what they ſaid, when, among other Sage Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, they advis'd
Mortals, <hi>Not to ſpeak Ill of the Dead, but to eſteem them Sacred, who
are gone into the Immortal State.</hi> And, <hi>Plato</hi>'s <hi>Ring</hi> had
this <hi>Motto</hi> on it, <hi>It is eaſier to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke the Dead, than to
pacifie them, when once provok'd.</hi> Intimating thereby, That the
<hi>Souls</hi> of the <hi>Departed,</hi> are ſenſible of the Injuries that
are done them by the <hi>Living.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Therefore I will ſhun Detraction, eſpecially of the Dead.
And, if I cannot ſay much in Praiſe of <hi>Sultan Ibrahim</hi>'s
<hi>Virtues,</hi> let his <hi>Vices</hi> be buried with him in <hi>Eternal
Oblivion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I run no Hazards in Writing thus frankly to thee, being
aſſur'd of thy Fidelity. Beſides, Death (which is the worſt
Puniſhment can be inflicted on me, for what I have ſaid, ſhould it be

               </head>
               <p>WHEN I informed thee, how the <hi>Scots</hi> had Sold their
<hi>King</hi> to the <hi>Engliſh Rebels,</hi> it was eaſie to preſage the
Conſequence, without a <hi>Revelation.</hi> When <hi>Sovereign Monarchs</hi>
become the <hi>Merchandiſe</hi> of <hi>Factions,</hi> they commonly pay the
<hi>Price</hi> with their own <hi>Blood.</hi> And, there are few Examples, of
<hi>Princes</hi> that have been Impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon'd by their <hi>Subjects,</hi> and
yet have eſcaped a Violent Death. For, thoſe who have once advanced ſo
far in their <hi>Treaſon,</hi> as to ſeize the <hi>Perſon</hi> of their
<hi>Sovereign,</hi> can never retire with Safety to themſelves; or, at
leaſt, their Own Guilt makes them think ſo. The Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciouſneſs of
what they have already done, prompts them to proceed in their Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs:
And, their Deſpair of ſaving their <hi>own</hi> Lives, makes them conclude
it Neceſſary to take away <hi>his,</hi> whoſe Violated
<hi>Majeſty,</hi> they fear, will never pardon ſo Impudent an Eſſay of
<hi>Treaſon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But, the Method which the <hi>Engliſh</hi> have taken to
Murder their <hi>King,</hi> has not a <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent</hi> in
<hi>Hiſtory.</hi> Theſe <hi>Infidels,</hi> have out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrip'd all Former
<hi>Traytors,</hi> in the Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance and Execution of their
<hi>Regicide:</hi> They <pb n="358" facs="tcp:99492:194"/>have even ſurpaſs'd
Themſelves, and their own Firſt Deſigns.</p>
               <p>It has been uſual for <hi>Traytors,</hi> to take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the
Life of a Depos'd <hi>Monarch</hi> Private<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, by Poiſon or Aſſaſſin,
either in Reſpect to his <hi>Royal Blood,</hi> or to avoid the
Poſſibility of a Reſcue, from any of his Loyal Friends and Subjects. But,
theſe <hi>Barbarians,</hi> were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved Publickly to inſult on
<hi>Majeſty,</hi> to brave the whole World in the Execution of their
Villainy, and make a Pompous Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion of their <hi>Treaſons.</hi> For,
they Erected a New <hi>Divan</hi> or <hi>Court</hi> of <hi>Judicature,</hi>
com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed of the moſt Infamous Traytors: There they formally Try'd their
<hi>Sovereign,</hi> by a <hi>Law</hi> of their <hi>own making;</hi> Condemn'd
him as a Tyrant and a Traytor: And finally, cauſed his Head to be chopt off
with an Axe, by an <hi>Executioner,</hi> before the Gates of his own
<hi>Palace,</hi> in the Sight of Thouſands of his <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects;</hi> that
ſo they might appear, not ſo much to Kill their <hi>King,</hi> as to
Deſtroy the <hi>Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy</hi> it ſelf, and Triumph in its Ruine.</p>
               <p>Haſt thou, O Venerable <hi>Judge</hi> of the
<hi>Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,</hi> ever Read or Heard of ſuch a Daring <hi>Treaſon?</hi>
All <hi>Europe</hi> ſtartles at the Monſtrous Fact. And, <hi>Cardinal
Mazarini</hi> himſelf, who carried on that Private Web of Factious De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns
in <hi>England,</hi> whoſe Firſt Threds his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceſſor
<hi>Richlieu</hi> had ſpun; yet expreſſed an Horror, at the News of this
<hi>Tragedy.</hi> And, I look not on this, to be an Artifice of Policy in him
to blind the World; but, a real Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of his Sentiments: For, he is too
ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous, <pb n="359" facs="tcp:99492:194"/>to approve ſo Barbarous a Proceeding,
againſt a <hi>Sovereign Monarch,</hi> though his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy.</p>
               <p>T'other Day he was heard to ſay, <hi>That in Revenge of
the</hi> King<hi>'s Murder, he would em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baraſs the Counſels of the</hi>
Engliſh Rebels, <hi>more than he had done thoſe of their</hi>
Sovereign.</p>
               <p>This was not ſpoken ſo ſecretly, but <hi>Mah<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mut</hi> had
Intelligence of it within an Hour: For, I have more Ears in <hi>Paris,</hi>
than thoſe in my Head, to hearken after the <hi>Intrigues</hi> of this
<hi>Miniſter:</hi> And, it will be difficult for him hereafter, to ſpeak,
write or act any Thing; no, not even in his Private Cloſet, which will not be
diſcloſed to me.</p>
               <p>Yet, though I thus watch his Motions as an Enemy, and do my
utmoſt, to render his Deſigns againſt the <hi>Ottoman Port,</hi>
Ineffectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al; I cannot in my Heart condemn this <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter,</hi> who all
the while, acts but the Part of a <hi>Faithful Servant</hi> and an <hi>Able
Stateſman,</hi> in ſtriving to aggrandize his <hi>Maſter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>His ſupporting alſo the <hi>Factions</hi> in
<hi>England,</hi> and nouriſhing the Diſcontents of that <hi>Giddy-Headed
People,</hi> were but the Reſult of his Zeal for his <hi>Country,</hi> and
for the <hi>Church</hi> whereof he is <hi>One</hi> of the <hi>Principal
Pillars:</hi> It being Evident from his Grief at that <hi>King</hi>'s Murder,
That he bore no Malice againſt him, but only ſought to humble him into
Terms of Compliance with <hi>France.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When I ſay this, I ſuppoſe the <hi>Cardinal</hi>'s Sorrow
on that Account, to be free from Fiction: But who knows, when the Actions, 
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:99492:195"/>of <hi>Stateſmen</hi> are Undiſguiz'd, and when not?
For, I am well aſſur'd, That whilſt his <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents</hi> were buſie in
Embroyling that <hi>Nation,</hi> he promiſed the Exil'd <hi>Engliſh
Queen,</hi> to aſſiſt her Husband with Men and Money, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt thoſe
very <hi>Rebels,</hi> with whom he held a Private Correſpondence, and to whom
his Coffers were really open.</p>
               <p>Moſt of the <hi>European Stateſmen,</hi> are cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted with
the <hi>Maxims</hi> of a certain Famous <hi>Writer,</hi> whom they call
<hi>Matchiavel.</hi> This <hi>State-Caſuiſt</hi> has taught them, to boggle
at no Crimes, which may advance the Ends they aim at; <hi>Every Thing,</hi> in
his Opinion, <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Honeſt, that is Succeſsful.</hi> Thus,
<hi>Policy</hi> among the <hi>Nazarenes,</hi> is Degenerated into <hi>Sordid
Craft:</hi> And, that which was once de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervedly eſteem'd a
<hi>Virtue,</hi> neceſſary to the <hi>Governments</hi> of the
<hi>World,</hi> is now turn'd into a <hi>Vice;</hi> of which the very Out-Laws,
Free-Booters and Pirates, are aſham'd.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>God,</hi> who ſuffer'd the <hi>Earth</hi> to be Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
